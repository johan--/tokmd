# tokmd repo-native spec namespace

The durable repo-native source-of-truth namespace for tokmd is `.tokmd-spec/`.

This namespace owns long-term proposal/spec/ADR/lane/closeout rails and keeps them separate from tool-specific execution state.

Existing accepted source-of-truth documents under `docs/proposals/`,
`docs/specs/`, `docs/adr/`, and `docs/plans/` remain valid until a deliberate
migration moves or supersedes them. New repo-native durable artifacts should be
rooted here or linked from `.tokmd-spec/index.toml` so agents can find the
current control plane without searching tool-local state.

## Durable ownership

The repo-native spec system owns content under:

- `.tokmd-spec/` (durable artifacts and indexes)
- `docs/` guidance that explains how contributors use these rails
- references to live `policy/*.toml` ledgers where relevant

## External and awareness-only namespaces

The following directories may exist but are not owned by this system:

- `.codex/`
- `.spec/`
- `.claude/`
- `.jules/`

Agents may read `.tokmd-spec/` to decide what to do, but durable rails must not be stored in those tool-specific directories.

## Source-of-truth chain

The expected durable chain is:

`roadmap -> proposal -> spec -> ADR -> lane tracker -> implementation plan -> PRs -> proof -> support/policy references -> closeout`

Artifacts in this chain are indexed in `.tokmd-spec/index.toml`.
