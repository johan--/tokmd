- Closed #1503 as superseded by #1554.
- Merged #1559: synthesized keeper for FFI/env/path sanitization. Added in-memory input path length/control-character validation and config/profile selector trim/control-character sanitization while preserving case-sensitive FFI modes and existing path semantics. Gates: `cargo test -p tokmd-core in_memory_inputs_rejects_`; `cargo test -p tokmd-core --test error_boundary`; `cargo test -p tokmd-core parse_scan_settings`; `cargo test -p tokmd sanitize_selector`; `cargo test -p tokmd get_profile_name`; `cargo clippy -p tokmd-core -p tokmd -- -D warnings`; `cargo fmt-check`; `git diff --check`; GitHub CI.
- Closed #1403/#1404/#1405/#1406 as superseded or declined by #1559.
- Merged #1564: synthesized keeper for browser GitHub ingest cache partitioning. Added a token-derived auth partition to in-memory cache keys without storing raw token text and proved token-specific misses plus same-token cache reuse. Gates: `npm --prefix web/runner run check`; `npm --prefix web/runner test`; `node --test web/runner/ingest.test.mjs`; `node --check web/runner/ingest.js`; `git diff --check`; GitHub CI.
- Closed #1411/#1413/#1415/#1417 as superseded by #1564.
- Merged #1565: synthesized keeper for `tokmd-types` optional-field serde omission coverage. Added source-local tests for omitted `CapabilityStatus.reason` and `ArtifactEntry.hash`.

- Closed #1479 as superseded by #1565.
- Closed #1480 as duplicate coverage: current main already has all-variant cockpit enum serde coverage in integration/contract tests and snapshots.
- Merged #1566: synthesized keeper for `tokmd-git` intent helper coverage. Added source-local intent classification tests and direct private word-boundary helper assertions after fixing the stale branch formatting issue. Gates: `cargo test -p tokmd-git classify_intent_`; `cargo test -p tokmd-git contains_word_respects_word_boundaries`; `cargo test -p tokmd-git`; `cargo fmt-check`; `git diff --check`; GitHub CI.
- Closed #1478 as superseded by #1566.
- Next cluster: Property/proptest improvements (#1463, #1464, #1465, #1466).

## Operating decisions

- Treat `tokmd-config` as retired. Do not merge restore-to-workspace PRs; salvage only tests or cleanup that fit `tokmd-settings` / `tokmd-core` / `tokmd` ownership.
- Treat `.jules` as an allowed knowledge workspace for durable specs, investigations, friction notes, persona learnings, and generated indexes. Prefer concise summaries over raw logs or repeated run transcripts.
- Prefer SRP submodules inside stable public crates over new implementation microcrates. Public crates should represent contracts, facades, adapters, or products.
- For cockpit/review work, improve cockpit as the current PR-review surface first. Do not merge competing `review` implementations until the artifact contract is clear.
