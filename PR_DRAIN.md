## Operating decisions

- Treat `tokmd-config` as retired. Do not merge restore-to-workspace PRs; salvage only tests or cleanup that fit `tokmd-settings` / `tokmd-core` / `tokmd` ownership.
- Treat `.jules` as an allowed knowledge workspace for durable specs, investigations, friction notes, persona learnings, and generated indexes. Prefer concise summaries over raw logs or repeated run transcripts.
- Prefer SRP submodules inside stable public crates over new implementation microcrates. Public crates should represent contracts, facades, adapters, or products.
- For cockpit/review work, improve cockpit as the current PR-review surface first. Do not merge competing `review` implementations until the artifact contract is clear.
