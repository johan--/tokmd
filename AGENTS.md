# Agent Guidance

Canonical shared repo guidance is mirrored in `agents/shared/repo.md`.
This file provides guidance to AI agents (Claude, Factory Droid, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Droid Auto Review

**tokmd** uses Factory Droid for automated code review. Droid runs on all pull requests using the safe action configuration with MiniMax BYOK, and can be invoked manually with `@droid review` or `@droid security` comments.

- See `agents/shared/droid-migration.md` for the rollout design
- See `.factory/rules/droid-review.md` for review standards and finding format
- See `.github/workflows/droid-review.yml` for auto-review configuration
- See `.github/workflows/droid.yml` for manual `@droid` command handling
- See `.github/workflows/droid-security-scan.yml` for scheduled security scanning

## Project Overview

**tokmd** is a Rust CLI tool and library that wraps the `tokei` library to generate "inventory receipts" and derived analytics of code repositories. It produces human-readable summaries (Markdown/TSV) and machine-friendly datasets (JSON/JSONL/CSV) for AI-native workflows, LLM context generation, and code analysis pipelines.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
cargo build                          # Debug build
cargo build --release                # Release build with LTO
cargo test --verbose                 # Run all tests
cargo fmt-fix                        # Format code across the workspace
cargo fmt-check                      # Verify workspace formatting
cargo trim-target --check            # Report reclaimable target/debug space
cargo sccache-check                  # Verify local sccache setup
cargo clippy -- -D warnings          # Lint with strict warnings
cargo install --path crates/tokmd    # Local install
```

On Windows, prefer `cargo fmt-fix` / `cargo fmt-check` over `cargo fmt --all`; the full workspace can exceed Cargo's formatter argv budget even when long paths are enabled.
Windows MSVC builds in this repo also default to line-table debuginfo to keep `target/debug` from being dominated by full PDBs.
If you need full local symbols for a debugging session, use `$env:RUSTFLAGS='-C debuginfo=2'; cargo test ...`.
For opt-in local build caching, use `cargo with-sccache ...`; the wrapper sets `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` and defaults `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` unless you pass `--keep-incremental`.
For cross-worktree cache reuse, use `cargo xtask sccache --basedir <PATH> -- <cargo args>` so the wrapper can set `SCCACHE_BASEDIRS` explicitly.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a tiered crate-and-module architecture:
**types → scan/model → format/adapters → analysis/cockpit/gate → core → products**.
Public crates represent durable contracts, facades, adapters, or products.
Implementation details that do not need an independent package live as
single-responsibility owner modules inside those crates.

### Crate Hierarchy

| Tier | Crate | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | `tokmd-types` | Core receipt data structures |
| 0 | `tokmd-analysis-types` | Analysis receipt types |
| 0 | `tokmd-settings` | Clap-free workflow settings |
| 0 | `tokmd-envelope` | Shared sensor/FFI envelope contracts |
| 0 | `tokmd-io-port` | Host-abstracted file access contracts |
| 1 | `tokmd-scan` | tokei wrapper for code scanning |
| 1 | `tokmd-model` | Aggregation logic (lang, module, file rows) |
| 1 | `tokmd-sensor` | Sensor substrate and report builder |
| 2 | `tokmd-format` | Output rendering, redaction, badges, export-tree, analysis rendering |
| 2 | `tokmd-git` | Git history analysis |
| 3 | `tokmd-analysis` | Analysis orchestration and enrichers |
| 3 | `tokmd-cockpit` | PR cockpit metrics and review evidence |
| 3 | `tokmd-gate` | Policy evaluation with JSON pointer rules |
| 4 | `tokmd-core` | Library facade with FFI layer |

| 5 | `tokmd-python` | PyO3 bindings for PyPI |
| 5 | `tokmd-node` | napi-rs bindings for npm |

Former helper microcrates such as redaction, scan-args, badge rendering,
analysis rendering, progress, module-key, path/exclude/math, tokeignore,
context policy/git, fun renderers, content/import enrichers, and tool-schema now
live as owner modules inside `tokmd-format`, `tokmd-scan`, `tokmd-model`,
`tokmd-analysis`, `tokmd-core`, or `tokmd`.

### Library API (tokmd-core)

The `tokmd-core` crate provides a clap-free library facade for embedding:

**Workflow Functions** (Rust):
- `lang_workflow(scan, lang) -> LangReceipt`
- `module_workflow(scan, module) -> ModuleReceipt`
- `export_workflow(scan, export) -> ExportReceipt`
- `diff_workflow(settings) -> DiffReceipt`

**FFI Layer** (`ffi::run_json`):
- Single JSON entrypoint: `run_json(mode, args_json) -> String`
- Modes: `lang`, `module`, `export`, `analyze`, `diff`, `version`
- Response envelope: `{"ok": bool, "data": {...}, "error": {...}}`

**Python Bindings** (tokmd-python):
- `tokmd.lang()`, `tokmd.module()`, `tokmd.export()`, `tokmd.analyze()`, `tokmd.diff()`
- Returns native Python dicts
- Releases GIL during long scans

**Node.js Bindings** (tokmd-node):
- All functions return Promises (async)
- Uses `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()` for non-blocking event loop

### Analysis Presets

| Preset | Includes |
|--------|----------|
| `receipt` | Core derived metrics (density, distribution, COCOMO) |
| `health` | + TODO density |
| `risk` | + Git hotspots, coupling, freshness |
| `supply` | + Assets, dependency lockfiles |
| `architecture` | + Import graph |
| `topics` | Semantic topic clouds |
| `security` | License radar, entropy profiling |
| `identity` | Archetype detection, corporate fingerprint |
| `git` | Predictive churn, advanced git metrics |
| `deep` | Everything (except fun) |
| `fun` | Eco-label, novelty outputs |

## Critical Patterns

### Deterministic Output
- Uses `BTreeMap` instead of `HashMap` everywhere for stable key ordering
- Sorting: descending by code lines, then by name
- Essential for golden snapshot tests and reproducible receipts

### Path Normalization
- All paths normalized to forward slashes (`/`) regardless of OS
- Always use `normalize_path()` before output
- Module keys computed from normalized paths

### Children/Embedded Language Handling
- `ChildrenMode::Collapse`: Merge embedded languages into parent totals
- `ChildrenMode::Separate`: Show as "(embedded)" rows
- Applies consistently across all commands

### Receipt Schema
- JSON outputs include envelope metadata with `schema_version`
- Increment schema_version when modifying JSON output structure
- Update `docs/schema.json` (formal JSON Schema) when structures change
- **Schema versions are separate for each receipt family**:
  - Core receipts (`lang`, `module`, `export`, `diff`, `run`): `SCHEMA_VERSION = 2` (in `tokmd-types`)
  - Analysis receipts: `ANALYSIS_SCHEMA_VERSION = 9` (in `tokmd-analysis-types`)
  - Cockpit receipts: `COCKPIT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 3` (in `tokmd-types`)
  - Handoff manifests: `HANDOFF_SCHEMA_VERSION = 5` (in `tokmd-types`)
  - Context receipts: `CONTEXT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 4` (in `tokmd-types`)
  - Context bundles: `CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2` (in `tokmd-types`)

### Feature Flags
- `git`: Git history analysis (uses shell `git log`)
- `content`: File content scanning (entropy, tags, hashing)
- `walk`: Filesystem traversal for assets

### Git Diff Syntax (Two-dot vs Three-dot)
When invoking `git diff` or `git log` with range syntax:

| Syntax | Meaning | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `A..B` | Commits reachable from B but not A | Comparing tags/releases (`cockpit`, `diff` commands) |
| `A...B` | Symmetric difference from merge-base | CI workflows comparing PR branches |

**Rule**: Use `..` (two dots) in cockpit/diff commands comparing releases or tags. Use `...` (three dots) only in CI workflows where you want changes since branch divergence.

## Testing

- **Integration tests**: `crates/tokmd/tests/` using `assert_cmd` + `predicates`
- **Golden snapshots**: Using `insta` crate (timestamps normalized)
- **Crate-level tests**: Each crate has its own `tests/` directory
- **Unit tests**: In-module tests
- **Property-based tests**: Using `proptest` across 14 crates for invariant verification
- **Fuzz targets**: 9 targets using `libfuzzer` (see `fuzz/` directory) with seed corpus and dictionaries
- **Mutation testing**: Using `cargo-mutants` for test quality verification (configured in `.cargo/mutants.toml`)

Run a single test:
```bash
cargo test test_name --verbose
```

Update snapshots:
```bash
cargo insta review
```

Run property tests:
```bash
cargo test -p tokmd-scan properties
```

Run mutation testing:
```bash
cargo mutants --file crates/tokmd-format/src/redact/mod.rs
```

Run fuzz targets:
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_entropy --features content
cargo +nightly fuzz list  # List all targets
```

## Dual-Repo Workbench Boundary

Normal tokmd development starts from `EffortlessMetrics/tokmd-swarm:main`.
Create narrow PRs there, wait for `Tokmd Rust Small Result`, and squash-merge
aligned work into the swarm repo.

`EffortlessMetrics/tokmd` is the publication repository. Do not push feature
work, release tags, GitHub releases, crates.io publishes, Docker pushes,
signing changes, or `v1` alias moves from swarm. Publication imports are
explicit merge-commit PRs in `tokmd`, followed by fast-forwarding
`tokmd-swarm/main` to the publication merge commit.

See `docs/ci/swarm-routing.md` for the shared-history topology and routing
rules.

## PR Triage Rules

### Codex and Jules state boundaries
- `.jules/**` is Jules provenance and ambient suggestion state. Treat it as
  useful repo input, not Codex's primary active-lane controller.
- Codex should use `AGENTS.md`, `docs/NEXT.md`, accepted docs/plans/specs/ADRs,
  PR context, and `.codex/**` state where present for Codex lane selection.
- Do not tell Jules to stop acting or remove Jules suggestions merely because
  Codex is working. Evaluate Jules suggestions like any other repo input.

### Jules provenance is intentional repo state
- Treat `.jules/**` logs, ledgers, envelopes, runbooks, and friction notes as intentional provenance unless a repo owner explicitly says otherwise.
- Do not close, trim, or reject a PR merely because it includes `.jules/**` files.
- If a Jules PR is merge-worthy, keep the `.jules/**` updates with it.
- Do not split `.jules/**` updates out into a second PR just to shrink the visible diff; keep the provenance attached to the substantive change.
- If a Jules PR is not ready, the reason must be the actual code issue: correctness, scope, stacking, validation, or launch relevance.

### When a Jules PR is bad
- Do not close a Jules PR because it has provenance files.
- Close, defer, or restack only for substantive reasons such as:
  - unrelated non-`.jules/**` changes are stacked into the branch
  - the code is incorrect
  - required validation fails
  - the change is not worth merging in the current phase

### Release-prep queue discipline
- Never close a PR merely because a release is near.
- During prep or RC hardening, classify each open PR by substance: release
  blocker, safe aligned change, useful non-blocking work, duplicate of a
  merged keeper, invalid/incorrect work, stale branch needing restack, or
  explicitly declined work.
- Merge release blockers and safe aligned PRs after validation. Leave useful
  non-blocking PRs open, parked, labeled, or restacked for later.
- Close a PR only for an intrinsic reason: it is invalid, duplicated or
  superseded by a merged keeper, stale beyond practical restack, conflicts with
  accepted direction, or was explicitly declined.
- Queue cleanliness is not a release criterion. Release readiness is proven by
  preflight, release-record accuracy, and clean release-surface evidence.

## Codex Commit / Push Policy

For PR-bound work, Codex may create scoped branches, commit scoped changes, push
branches, open PRs, update PR branches, and merge aligned PRs after validation
without asking for additional user confirmation.

PR-bound work includes requests to implement, review, improve, merge, drain PRs,
prepare release docs, update changelogs, fix tests, or otherwise carry a repo
task through completion.

Do not ask for extra permission merely because a commit, push, PR update, or
aligned merge is needed to finish that task.

Ask before committing, pushing, or merging only when:

- the user explicitly requested read-only or local-only work;
- the task is exploratory and no implementation was requested;
- the mutation would publish crates, create tags, create GitHub releases, move
  release aliases, push images, rotate secrets, or change external-service
  ownership;
- the diff is broad or ambiguous relative to the requested lane;
- the worktree contains unrelated user changes that cannot be isolated safely.
