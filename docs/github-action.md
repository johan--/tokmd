# GitHub Action Reference

The root `EffortlessMetrics/tokmd` composite Action installs a released `tokmd` binary, runs one workflow mode, and optionally uploads generated files or posts a pull request comment.

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: tokmd receipt

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  receipt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - uses: EffortlessMetrics/tokmd@v1
        with:
          version: '1.10.0'
          paths: .
          artifact: 'true'
          comment: 'true'
```

## Versioning Model

There are two version choices in every workflow:

| Setting | Meaning | Example |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Action ref | Which repository ref GitHub uses for `action.yml` | `EffortlessMetrics/tokmd@v1` |
| `version` input | Which released `tokmd` binary the Action downloads | `version: '1.10.0'` |

Use stable workflows like this:

```yaml
- uses: EffortlessMetrics/tokmd@v1
  with:
    version: '1.10.0'
    paths: .
```

For release-candidate smoke tests, pin both the Action ref and the downloaded binary:

```yaml
- uses: EffortlessMetrics/tokmd@v1.10.0-rc.1
  with:
    version: '1.10.0-rc.1'
    paths: .
```

If `version` does not start with `v`, the Action prepends it before downloading release assets.

| `version` input | Release tag |
| :-------------- | :---------- |
| `1.10.0` | `v1.10.0` |
| `v1.10.0` | `v1.10.0` |
| `1.10.0-rc.1` | `v1.10.0-rc.1` |

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Purpose |
| :---- | :------- | :------ | :------ |
| `mode` | no | `(omitted)` | `tokmd` mode to run: `module`, `export`, `gate`, `cockpit`, `sensor`, or `baseline`. Omit it for the default module plus export flow. |
| `version` | no | `latest` | `tokmd` release to install. Use an explicit version when you want the Action ref and binary version to stay aligned. |
| `paths` | no | `.` | Paths to scan. Values are split on whitespace and passed as separate path arguments. |
| `module-roots` | no | `crates,packages` | Module root prefixes for `module`, `export`, and the default flow. |
| `top` | no | `20` | Number of rows shown in Markdown summaries. |
| `format` | no | `json` | Export receipt format for `export` and the default flow: `json`, `jsonl`, or `csv`. |
| `base` | no | `(inferred)` | Base git ref for `cockpit` and `sensor`. Explicit values are used as provided. When omitted, pull request runs use `origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF`; other runs use `origin/HEAD` when available. |
| `head` | no | `HEAD` | Head git ref for `cockpit` and `sensor`. |
| `artifact` | no | `true` | Upload generated tokmd files as workflow artifacts. |
| `comment` | no | `true` | Post the generated Markdown summary as a pull request comment when running on `pull_request` events. |
| `review-packet` | no | `false` | For `mode: cockpit`, also emit the cockpit review packet directory and use its `comment.md` as the Markdown summary/comment body. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `receipt` | Path to the generated receipt file when one is produced. |
| `summary` | Path to `tokmd-summary.md`, `comment.md`, or another mode-specific Markdown summary when one is produced. |
| `gate-verdict` | Path to `tokmd-gate-verdict.json` when `mode: gate` is used. |
| `cockpit-report` | Path to `tokmd-cockpit-report.json` when `mode: cockpit` is used. |
| `review-packet` | Path to `.tokmd/review` when `mode: cockpit` and `review-packet: 'true'` are used. |
| `sensor-report` | Path to `tokmd-sensor-report.json` when `mode: sensor` is used. |
| `baseline-report` | Path to `tokmd-baseline.json` when `mode: baseline` is used. |

## Modes

### Omitted Mode

When `mode` is omitted, the Action preserves the original workflow behavior:

- runs `tokmd module --format md`
- writes `tokmd-summary.md`
- runs `tokmd export --format <format>`
- writes `tokmd-receipt.<format>`

### `module`

Runs `tokmd module --format md` and writes `tokmd-summary.md`.

### `export`

Runs `tokmd export --format <format>` and writes `tokmd-receipt.<format>`.

Supported `format` values are `json`, `jsonl`, and `csv`.

### `gate`

Runs `tokmd gate --format json` and writes `tokmd-gate-verdict.json`.

`gate` expects policy or ratchet rules from `tokmd.toml` in the checkout. It accepts exactly one path. A failing gate still writes `tokmd-gate-verdict.json`, then the Action fails after exposing the verdict file.

### `cockpit`

Runs `tokmd cockpit --format json` and writes `tokmd-cockpit-report.json`.

If `base` is omitted, the Action infers a repository-aware base ref. Set `base` only when you want to override that inference.

When `review-packet: 'true'`, cockpit mode also runs with
`--review-packet-dir .tokmd/review`. The `review-packet` output points to that
directory, and the `summary` output points to the packet-local
`.tokmd/review/comment.md`.

When artifact upload is enabled, the Action also prepares
`tokmd-review-packet-comment.md` from `.tokmd/review/comment.md` and appends
hosted packet metadata: the workflow run URL, the `tokmd-receipts` artifact
name, and the packet path. The packet's own `comment.md` remains unchanged so
`manifest.json` hashes stay valid, while pull request comments still point to
hosted artifacts.

### `sensor`

Runs `tokmd sensor --format json` and writes:

- `tokmd-sensor-report.json`
- `comment.md`
- `extras/`

The `summary` output points to `comment.md`. `sensor` uses the same base inference behavior as `cockpit`.

### `baseline`

Runs `tokmd baseline --force` and writes `tokmd-baseline.json`.

`baseline` accepts exactly one path.

## Artifacts

When `artifact: 'true'`, generated files are uploaded as a workflow artifact.

Artifact candidates include:

- `tokmd-summary.md`
- `tokmd-receipt.*`
- `tokmd-gate-verdict.json`
- `tokmd-cockpit-report.json`
- `tokmd-review-packet-comment.md`
- `.tokmd/review`
- `tokmd-sensor-report.json`
- `tokmd-baseline.json`
- `comment.md`
- `extras/`

## PR Comments

Pull request comments require:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

Commenting only runs on `pull_request` events. Set `comment: 'false'` for scheduled jobs, push jobs, private smoke tests, or workflows where comments are not desired.

The default flow comments with `tokmd-summary.md`. `sensor` comments with `comment.md`. JSON-only modes such as `gate`, `cockpit`, and `baseline` normally leave the `summary` output empty. `cockpit` with `review-packet: 'true'` comments with the packet summary, using `tokmd-review-packet-comment.md` when hosted packet metadata is added.

For cockpit review packets, the Action copies `.tokmd/review/comment.md` to
`tokmd-review-packet-comment.md` and appends a short hosted-packet block before
posting the pull request comment. With `artifact: 'true'`, the block points
reviewers to the workflow run and `tokmd-receipts` artifact that contains the
full `.tokmd/review/` directory. With artifact upload disabled, the comment
states that the packet was generated locally in the workflow workspace but not
uploaded. The packet-local `comment.md` is not mutated after generation.

## Checkout Guidance

The default, `module`, `export`, `gate`, and `baseline` modes can usually use a normal checkout:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
```

For `cockpit` and `sensor` in external pull request workflows, prefer full history so compare refs are available:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0

- uses: EffortlessMetrics/tokmd@v1
  with:
    version: '1.10.0'
    mode: cockpit
    head: HEAD
    artifact: 'true'
    comment: 'false'
```

## Multi-Path Behavior

Multiple scan paths can be passed on one line:

```yaml
paths: "src crates"
```

or as a multiline value:

```yaml
paths: |
  src
  packages
```

`gate` and `baseline` accept exactly one path. Same-line or multiline multi-path inputs fail before `tokmd` runs.

## Base And Head Inference

`cockpit` and `sensor` compare a base ref and a head ref.

When `base` is omitted:

- pull request runs use `origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF`
- other runs use `origin/HEAD` when available

Set `base` explicitly only when you want to override inference:

```yaml
with:
  mode: sensor
  base: origin/main
  head: HEAD
```

The default `head` is `HEAD`.

## Failure Behavior

The Action fails early for:

- unsupported modes
- unsupported runner architectures
- unresolved release assets
- checksum mismatches
- invalid `gate` or `baseline` path counts
- unresolved `cockpit` or `sensor` base refs

`mode: gate` preserves `tokmd-gate-verdict.json` before failing when the policy verdict fails.

## Release Assets And Checksums

The Action installs `tokmd` from GitHub Release assets.

Supported binary assets:

- `tokmd-linux-amd64`
- `tokmd-linux-arm64`
- `tokmd-macos-amd64`
- `tokmd-macos-arm64`
- `tokmd-windows-amd64.exe`

When `checksums.txt` exists on the release, the Action verifies the downloaded binary before running it.

Stable release tags update the `v1` major tag. Release-candidate tags such as `v1.10.0-rc.1` are prereleases, do not become the latest release, and do not move `v1`.
