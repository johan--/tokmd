# Spec: AST Shadow Artifacts

- Status: draft
- Schema family, if any: `tokmd.ast_shadow.v1`
- Related ADRs: `docs/adr/0008-ast-foundation.md`
- Related proof scopes: `analysis_ast_shadow`

## Contract

AST shadow artifacts are developer-facing comparison evidence for future
language-aware analysis. They exist to compare current heuristic facts with
feature-gated AST facts without changing default `tokmd` receipts, schemas,
browser capabilities, bindings, or CI gates.

During shadow mode:

- default `tokmd analyze`, `tokmd cockpit`, `tokmd context`, `tokmd handoff`,
  FFI, Python, Node, and WASM outputs must remain unchanged;
- AST parsing must stay behind the explicit `ast` feature;
- Rust is the only parser-backed language until comparison evidence justifies a
  later language slice;
- generated shadow artifacts are not merge verdicts, proof promotion receipts,
  or evidencebus packets;
- any future public receipt field that changes meaning because of AST evidence
  requires schema-family review before adoption.

## Inputs

The first shadow slice may read:

- normalized repository-relative source paths;
- Rust source text for files selected by a future shadow runner;
- heuristic facts already produced by existing analysis modules;
- AST capability metadata from `tokmd-analysis` when built with
  `--features ast`.

The shadow path must not require:

- network access;
- GitHub Actions metadata;
- Codecov upload;
- evidencebus runtime dependencies;
- browser/WASM AST support.

## Outputs

The stable developer-facing output directory is:

```text
target/tokmd-ast-shadow/
  heuristic.json
  ast.json
  diff.json
```

The artifact set uses schema family `tokmd.ast_shadow.v1`.

`heuristic.json` should record the existing heuristic facts selected for
comparison, including normalized paths and stable identifiers.

`ast.json` should record parser-backed Rust facts selected for comparison,
including parser capability metadata, normalized paths, landmarks, parser
status, and recoverable parse-error state.

`diff.json` should record deterministic comparison results between heuristic
and AST facts. It should distinguish exact matches, AST-only facts,
heuristic-only facts, parse-degraded files, and unsupported files.

All three artifacts must avoid timestamps, absolute paths, environment-specific
temporary directories, and nondeterministic ordering.

## Compatibility

AST shadow artifacts are intentionally outside the public receipt contract.
Existing receipt schemas remain authoritative:

- core receipts stay under `tokmd-types`;
- analysis receipts stay under `tokmd-analysis-types`;
- cockpit receipts stay under `tokmd-types`;
- context and handoff schemas stay under `tokmd-types`.

Shadow artifacts may be versioned independently. A future migration from
shadow evidence into public receipts must:

- identify the affected schema family;
- explain whether the new field is additive or changes existing meaning;
- preserve heuristic fallback for unsupported languages and runtimes;
- keep browser/WASM capability reporting honest;
- update proof scopes before public behavior changes.

## Proof Requirements

Any PR that changes the AST shadow contract, AST parser code, or shadow artifact
names should run:

```bash
cargo test -p tokmd-analysis --features ast ast --verbose
cargo xtask proof-policy --check
cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json-output target/proof/affected-ast-shadow.json
cargo xtask proof --profile affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --plan --plan-json target/proof/proof-plan-ast-shadow.json --evidence-json target/proof/proof-evidence-ast-shadow.json
cargo fmt-check
git diff --check
```

If the change touches public crate exports, dependencies, schemas, browser/WASM
capabilities, or package surfaces, also run the relevant owner checks, including
publish-surface verification when package/public API boundaries move.

## Open Questions

- Which existing heuristic fact family should be the first full
  heuristic-vs-AST comparison target: function boundaries, imports, or
  complexity landmarks?
- Whether the first runner should live in `tokmd-analysis`, `tokmd`, or `xtask`
  while the artifact remains developer-facing.
- What corpus size and performance envelope are required before any AST-derived
  public receipt field is proposed.
