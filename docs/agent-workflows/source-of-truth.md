# Agent Source-of-Truth Workflow

Status: active workflow guide.

Use this guide when starting, continuing, or handing off a tokmd lane. It is
operational guidance for humans and agents; the durable ownership rules remain
in `.tokmd-spec/`, `.tokmd-spec/index.toml`, `docs/source-of-truth.md`,
`docs/specs/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/plans/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/` state where
present, `ci/proof.toml`, and `policy/*.toml`.

For Codex work, `.jules/**` is Jules provenance and ambient suggestion state.
Review it when relevant, but do not treat it as Codex's primary active-lane
controller.

## Before Starting

1. Check the open PR queue.
2. Read `docs/NEXT.md` for the current operating mode.
3. Read `.tokmd-spec/index.toml`, then the accepted plan, linked spec, ADR,
   proposal, or policy file named by current repo guidance or PR context.
4. Review `.jules/goals/active.toml` as Jules-local context when it is relevant,
   not as Codex's primary lane selector.
5. Confirm `docs/NEXT.md`, accepted docs/plans/specs/ADRs, and the PR context do
   not contradict each other.

If those artifacts disagree, stop and fix the routing artifact that owns the
truth before opening an implementation branch.

## Choosing The Owning Artifact

- Use a proposal for why, alternatives, and open questions.
- Use a spec for behavior contracts, artifact shapes, compatibility, and proof
  requirements.
- Use an ADR for durable architecture, packaging, governance, or product-boundary
  decisions.
- Use a plan for PR order, dependencies, validation commands, and stop
  conditions.
- Use `.tokmd-spec/` and `.tokmd-spec/index.toml` for repo-native durable rails
  and for links to durable artifacts that still live under `docs/`.
- Use `.jules/goals/active.toml` only for Jules-local machine-readable state and
  suggestions.
- Use `.codex/` for Codex-local tracked state when a Codex workflow needs a
  durable in-repo packet.
- Use `ci/proof.toml` and `policy/*.toml` for machine-checkable rules.
- Use PR bodies for review-local evidence and links, not as the only durable
  source of truth when a repo artifact should exist.

## While Changing Docs

When a change touches source-of-truth artifacts:

1. Keep each artifact in its lane. Do not put implementation sequencing in a
   spec, or durable architecture rationale in an active-goal file.
2. Update checked TOML policy when the claim should be enforced by tooling.
3. Keep `.jules/goals/active.toml` short and Jules-local when it is changed.
4. Do not let `.jules/goals/active.toml` become a Codex controller or run log.
5. Archive a completed or superseded active goal under `.jules/goals/archive/`
   only when the Jules-local machine-readable checkpoint has durable value.
6. Run the documentation artifact checker before opening the PR.

## PR Body Checklist

For non-trivial source-of-truth changes, the PR body should include:

- linked source-of-truth artifact or active goal;
- changed layer, such as proposal, spec, ADR, plan, active goal, policy, or
  proof scope;
- validation commands and result summary;
- stop condition or parking rationale if the work is intentionally incomplete;
- explicit note when product behavior, schemas, proof promotion, Codecov
  defaults, or publish surface are not changed.

## Validation

Use the relevant subset:

```bash
cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check --json target/docs/doc-artifacts-check.json
cargo xtask docs --check
cargo xtask proof-policy --check
cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json-output target/proof/affected.json
cargo xtask proof --profile affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --plan
cargo fmt-check
git diff --check
```

Run package, schema, or publish-surface checks only when the changed artifacts
touch those surfaces.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before implementation when:

- `docs/NEXT.md`, accepted docs/plans/specs/ADRs, and the PR context disagree;
- a behavior or artifact shape change has no owning spec;
- an architecture boundary change has no ADR;
- a machine-checkable claim has no policy owner;
- the affected proof plan reports unknown files for source-of-truth changes;
- validation output does not cover the PR's stated contract.
