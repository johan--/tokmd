## Goal

Broaden AST shadow evidence for Rust function-boundary precision after the
first candidate-decision lane closed as `not yet`.

The previous lane proved that `cargo xtask ast-shadow-compare` and
`cargo xtask ast-shadow-check` can produce deterministic, verified evidence
from the repo-owned corpus manifest. It also classified the first corpus:
function-boundary mismatches were explainable, but the corpus was too small to
justify a public candidate proposal.

This lane should make the evidence less narrow while preserving shadow-mode
boundaries:

```text
broader explicit Rust corpus
  -> deterministic ast-shadow artifacts
  -> verifier receipt
  -> mismatch classification
  -> timing evidence
  -> public-candidate decision later
```

## Non-goals

- Do not add a public `tokmd ast`, `tokmd review`, or new product command.
- Do not change default `tokmd analyze`, `cockpit`, `context`, `handoff`,
  browser/WASM, FFI, Python, or Node outputs.
- Do not add public receipt fields or change schema meaning.
- Do not claim browser/WASM AST capability.
- Do not promote proof gates, scoped coverage, mutation, fast proof, or Codecov
  upload.
- Do not treat AST shadow diffs as merge verdicts, pass/fail proof, or review
  blockers.
- Do not implement cockpit or handoff AST integration from this lane.
- Do not expand into import or control-flow public-candidate decisions.

## Work Packets

1. Define corpus expansion categories.
   - Status: complete.
   - Record the file categories needed for a stronger decision: production
     code, tests, examples, macro-heavy files, generated-ish files,
     docs-adjacent Rust snippets, and parser-degraded fixtures.
2. Extend the repo-owned corpus manifest.
   - Status: complete.
   - Add explicit repo-relative Rust paths to `policy/ast-shadow-corpus.toml`.
   - Keep file reasons and expected signals specific.
   - Preserve absolute-path and path-escape rejection.
3. Collect verified expanded-corpus evidence.
   - Status: complete.
   - Run `ast-shadow-compare` and `ast-shadow-check` over the expanded manifest.
   - Record counts by landmark kind and function-boundary mismatch class.
4. Add candidate-corpus timing evidence.
   - Status: pending.
   - Use existing `tokmd.ast_shadow_perf.v1` evidence or add a scoped timing
     receipt for the expanded explicit corpus before making performance claims.
5. Reclassify function-boundary mismatches.
   - Status: pending.
   - Categorize heuristic-only and AST-only function landmarks using the
     buckets from `docs/specs/ast-shadow.md`.
6. Revisit the candidate decision.
   - Status: pending.
   - Choose one outcome: ready for public-candidate proposal, not yet, or
     shadow-only deferral.

## Validation

Docs-only slices should run:

```bash
cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check
cargo xtask docs --check
cargo xtask proof-policy --check
cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json-output target/proof/affected-ast-function-boundary-corpus.json
cargo xtask proof --profile affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --plan --plan-json target/proof/proof-plan-ast-function-boundary-corpus.json --evidence-json target/proof/proof-evidence-ast-function-boundary-corpus.json
cargo fmt-check
git diff --check
```

Corpus, runner, or AST-code slices should also run the relevant focused proof:

```bash
cargo test -p tokmd-analysis --features ast ast --verbose
cargo run -p tokmd-analysis --features ast --example ast_shadow_perf -- --iterations 2 --files 2 --functions-per-file 3 --out target/perf/ast-shadow-perf.json
cargo test -p xtask ast_shadow --verbose
cargo xtask ast-shadow-compare --manifest policy/ast-shadow-corpus.toml --out target/tokmd-ast-shadow-corpus --summary-md target/tokmd-ast-shadow-corpus/summary.md
cargo xtask ast-shadow-check --manifest policy/ast-shadow-corpus.toml --dir target/tokmd-ast-shadow-corpus --json target/tokmd-ast-shadow-corpus/check.json
```

If public crate exports, dependencies, browser/WASM capability claims, schemas,
bindings, or package surfaces move, also run the relevant owner checks and
publish-surface verification.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if the lane requires a public `tokmd` command before a public candidate
  proposal exists.
- Stop if AST evidence changes default product receipts or browser/WASM
  capability claims.
- Stop if parser degradation is hidden or counted as available proof.
- Stop if unsupported files are counted as successful AST evidence.
- Stop if control-flow or import evidence is promoted by piggybacking on the
  function-boundary decision.
- Stop if proof, scoped coverage, mutation, fast proof, or Codecov upload is
  promoted by this lane.
- Stop if evidencebus runtime implementation becomes necessary.
- Stop if affected planning reports unknown files.
- Stop if generated `target/` artifacts are staged or committed.

## Checkpoint History

- 2026-05-14: Started after the AST function-boundary candidate decision closed
  as `not yet`. The next evidence need is broader corpus coverage, not product
  integration.
- 2026-05-14: Defined the corpus category taxonomy and extended
  `policy/ast-shadow-corpus.toml` with production, test, macro-heavy,
  generated-like, product-adjacent, shadow-implementation, and tooling entries.
- 2026-05-14: Collected verified expanded-corpus evidence from the 14-file
  manifest. Function landmarks had 225 matches, 24 heuristic-only entries,
  and 0 AST-only entries; one parser-degraded fixture remained explicit.

## Corpus Expansion Categories

The expanded manifest should make each selected Rust file explain why it is in
the function-boundary evidence set. A future public-candidate decision should
not rely on a corpus that is accidentally weighted toward parser internals or
clean fixtures.

| Category | Purpose | Expected signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fixture_baseline` | Keep a small known-clean Rust file with ordinary imports, one function, and simple control flow. | Verifies runner, parser, and comparison plumbing without production noise. |
| `fixture_parse_degraded` | Keep at least one intentionally malformed Rust file. | Proves parse degradation remains explicit and is not counted as available AST proof. |
| `shadow_implementation` | Cover AST shadow parser, artifact builder, and comparison internals. | Keeps the evidence machinery itself represented without mistaking it for user-facing output. |
| `production_implementation` | Cover ordinary shipped Rust modules outside AST-specific code. | Shows function-boundary behavior on code users actually maintain. |
| `heuristic_implementation` | Cover the current heuristic extraction code and its tests. | Finds where heuristics over-report or under-report their own edge cases. |
| `test_corpus` | Cover unit or integration tests with helper functions and assertion-heavy bodies. | Separates real test helper functions from assertion text or embedded snippets. |
| `fixture_string_risk` | Cover files that embed Rust examples inside strings, raw strings, or docs-adjacent examples. | Measures the known heuristic false-positive class without treating it as production code. |
| `macro_heavy` | Cover files that use macro invocations, generated implementations, or declarative helper macros. | Identifies macro-shaped function-boundary disagreement before public claims. |
| `generated_like` | Cover checked-in generated-ish or mechanically repetitive Rust when present. | Checks whether repetition or generated style skews counts or ordering. |
| `product_adjacent_surface` | Cover review, handoff, cockpit, or context-selection code where function precision might later matter. | Keeps evidence connected to plausible user-visible surfaces without changing them. |
| `tooling_implementation` | Cover `xtask` runner/checker code that produces or verifies AST shadow evidence. | Proves the developer evidence tooling itself is represented in the corpus. |

Selection should stay explicit and repo-relative. Each manifest entry should
carry a narrow `reason`, a stable `category`, and an `expected_signal` that can
be checked after `ast-shadow-compare` and `ast-shadow-check` run. The expanded
corpus does not need every category in one PR, but the next candidate decision
should state which categories were present, which were absent, and why.

| `xtask/src/tasks/ast_shadow_compare.rs` | 39 | 6 | 0 | no |

Interpretation:

- Function-boundary AST-only misses remain at zero in the expanded corpus.
- Heuristic-only function entries remain real evidence to classify, not proof
  of readiness.
- The intentionally degraded fixture still appears as degraded evidence rather
  than available AST proof.
- Control-flow remains noisier than function boundaries and stays out of this
  candidate decision.
