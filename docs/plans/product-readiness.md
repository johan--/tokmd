## Goal

Make the main tokmd jobs obvious for users who do not care about the internal
control plane:

```text
1. Tell me what this repo is.
2. Tell me what changed.
3. Help me review this PR.
4. Give CI stable evidence and gates.
5. Give my coding agent the right context and proof expectations.
```

The first pass should simplify and connect existing surfaces. It should not add
new product commands or promote advisory proof.

## Non-goals

- Do not add a separate `tokmd review` command before it has a distinct
  artifact contract from cockpit.
- Do not promote fast proof, scoped coverage, mutation, or Codecov upload.
- Do not make README or tutorial examples depend on unpublished behavior.
- Do not turn onboarding docs into architecture inventory.
- Do not implement evidencebus export in this lane.

## Work Packets

1. Add a cockpit review-packet quickstart.
   - Status: complete.
   - Show the local commands for generating doc-artifacts evidence when
     available, running `tokmd cockpit`, and checking the review packet.
   - Explain which packet files a reviewer should open first.
   - Evidence: `docs/review-packet.md` now starts with a reviewer quickstart,
     while README, tutorial, recipes, and `docs/tokmd-in-cockpit.md` keep the
     same workflow available from their user-facing entry points.
2. Simplify README first-run paths around the five user jobs.
   - Status: complete.
   - Keep the command inventory available, but lead with the smallest useful
     commands for inspection, PR review, CI evidence, and agent handoff.
   - Evidence: README now leads with the five user jobs, and
     `docs/start-here.md` provides the job-oriented bridge into tutorial,
     review-packet, Action, handoff, and browser/native docs.
3. Refresh tutorial and recipes around job-to-be-done flows.
   - Status: complete.
   - Prefer short workflows that produce a visible receipt before explaining
     the underlying proof or schema machinery.
   - Evidence: `docs/tutorial.md` and `docs/recipes.md` now start with
     job-oriented routing tables that point users to the relevant existing
     workflow before explaining lower-level commands.
4. Tighten browser/native capability guidance.
   - Status: complete.
   - Keep browser mode as a no-install artifact generator with explicit
     native-only boundaries.
   - Evidence: `docs/browser.md` now gives the browser-safe workflow, supported
     modes, input model, downloadable artifact role, and native-only boundaries,
     with links from README, docs index, and Start Here.
5. Keep handoff docs aligned with the shipped link artifacts and `work-order.md`.
   - Status: complete.
   - The guide should tell agents how to consume links, not imply handoff
     verifies external receipts.
   - Evidence: `docs/handoff.md` now distinguishes the self-contained
     source/context bundle from external review/proof evidence handles, tells
     agents how to consume `review-links.json` and `proof-links.json`, and keeps
     verification authority with the review-packet verifier and proof receipts.

## Validation

For docs-only PRs in this lane, run:

```bash
cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check
cargo xtask docs --check
cargo xtask proof-policy --check
cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json
cargo xtask proof --profile affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --plan
cargo fmt-check
git diff --check
```

For PRs that change examples tied to generated CLI reference output, also run
the relevant generator/checker listed by `cargo xtask docs --check`.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if a user-facing workflow needs behavior the CLI does not currently
  support.
- Stop before adding new proof gates, Codecov defaults, or merge verdicts.
- Stop before adding a new command when existing `cockpit`, `handoff`, `gate`,
  or `context` surfaces can express the workflow.
- Stop if affected planning reports unknown files for docs, source-of-truth, or
  proof-policy changes.

## Checkpoint History

- 2026-05-13: Created after the agent-handoff readiness lane completed. The
  next product-readiness slice should make existing review, CI, browser, and
  agent workflows easier to start without expanding the control plane.
- 2026-05-13: Added a reviewer quickstart to `docs/review-packet.md`, keeping
  the first review-packet path visible on the packet contract page without
  adding a new command or changing proof policy.
- 2026-05-13: Added `docs/start-here.md` and changed README's first-run block
  to lead with the five user jobs instead of a command inventory. The new guide
  is routed through the `user_guides` proof scope.
- 2026-05-14: Added job-routing tables to tutorial and recipes so the detailed
  docs now start from user jobs instead of command order alone.
- 2026-05-14: Added browser/native guidance that keeps browser mode framed as a
  no-install artifact generator and leaves git-backed review, gates, baselines,
  context, and handoff native-first.
- 2026-05-14: Completed the first product-readiness pass by clarifying how
  coding agents should consume handoff link artifacts without treating handoff
  as a verifier for external review or proof receipts.
