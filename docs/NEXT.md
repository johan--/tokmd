# Next Program

The generated PR drain is complete. `PR_DRAIN.md` is now a historical ledger for the duplicate/stale queue and should only change for PR-drain-specific corrections. Active product and control-plane work moves here.

Factory Droid PR #1541 was declined in its original external-service form. A
later safe Droid migration is now active through the pinned
`EffortlessMetrics/droid-action-safe` wrapper with MiniMax BYOK, same-repo /
trusted-actor guards, disabled raw debug artifacts, and the service policy in
`docs/external-services.md`.

## Current Operating Mode

The Rust-native proof control plane is in routine-observation mode. It now owns
proof policy, affected planning, scoped advisory execution, executor
observation collection, fast proof-run observation collection, and artifact
verification. Do not promote fast proof into the required aggregate or enable
default Codecov upload without a fresh maintainer decision backed by collected
evidence.

The v1.11 browser runtime polish lane is closed on main: cache semantics,
worker and repo-load progress, retry/rate-limit guidance, authenticated fetch
UX, loaded-bundle capability filtering, and local browser file input are all
implemented.

The cockpit review-packet lane is stable for explicit proof imports: review
packets can preserve imported proof artifacts, surface proof evidence in
`evidence.json`, `review-map.md`, and `comment.md`, and verify packet-local
hashes without promoting proof gates. Keep `tokmd cockpit` as the PR-review
evidence surface before adding any separate `tokmd review` command.

Architecture consolidation is paused unless fresh product or proof evidence
shows a real owner-module problem. The performance mini-lane has a measurement
spine and several small fixes on main; future performance work should continue
to cite `cargo xtask perf-smoke` receipts or explicitly say it is
structure-only.

The source-of-truth stack is installed and in routine maintenance: proposals
own exploratory rationale, specs own behavior contracts and proof
requirements, ADRs own durable architecture decisions, plans own sequencing,
`.jules/goals/active.toml` owns small machine-readable active-agent state, and
checked policy TOMLs own machine-enforced rules. The completed doc-artifacts
checker plan is closed out. Agent handoff readiness has also closed through
linked review/proof artifacts and `work-order.md`. The first product-readiness
user-path pass is complete: README, Start Here, review-packet docs, tutorial,
recipes, browser guidance, and handoff guidance now start from user jobs instead
of control-plane internals. The artifact glossary lane is complete as a
follow-on compression pass, giving users one dictionary for review packets,
proof receipts, handoff bundles, documentation-control receipts, and browser
artifacts. The first AST shadow contract slice is complete and the first
feature-gated `tokmd-analysis` artifact builder exists: it can build and write
developer-facing `tokmd.ast_shadow.v1` heuristic, AST, and diff artifacts from
caller-supplied heuristic landmarks plus Rust Tree-sitter landmarks while
preserving default receipt, browser, proof-promotion, and Codecov behavior. The
Rust shadow parser now records function, import, and simple control-flow
landmarks behind the existing `ast` feature. The AST shadow lane also has a
developer-facing synthetic performance receipt example so parser and artifact
builder timings can be collected before any public behavior change is proposed.
The AST comparison-runner lane is closed through first enforcement: the
developer-facing runner, verifier, Markdown summary, proof routing, fixture
corpus, first internal-corpus evidence, broader five-file corpus evidence, and
function-boundary candidate decision are recorded in
`docs/plans/ast-shadow-comparison-runner.md`. AST work must stay out of default
product workflows until a fresh plan uses broader comparison evidence to justify
a public schema or behavior proposal. Control-flow evidence remains shadow-only.

The AST function-boundary candidate-decision lane is closed with outcome
`not yet`. The first manifest corpus was repeatable and verified, and its
function-boundary mismatches were classified, but it was too narrow to justify
a public candidate proposal. AST function-boundary evidence remains
developer-facing shadow evidence.

The AST function-boundary corpus-expansion lane is closed with outcome
`not yet`. The broader repo-owned corpus, scoped timing receipt, and expanded
mismatch classification are useful shadow evidence: they show AST can avoid
heuristic over-reporting from embedded Rust source strings, but they do not yet
justify a public function-boundary candidate proposal. There is no active AST
productization lane. Future AST work should start from a fresh proposal that
names the product surface, schema family, fallback behavior, browser/WASM
reporting, proof ownership, and rollback story before implementation. The
closed plan lives in `docs/plans/ast-function-boundary-corpus-expansion.md`;
the earlier candidate decision is recorded in
`docs/plans/ast-function-boundary-candidate.md`.

The proof-observation decision-readiness lane is closed. It now has a
Rust-owned `cargo xtask proof-observation-status` aggregate,
`cargo xtask proof-observation-status-check` verifier, manual collector upload
path, and ADR-0009 decision record. The outcome is continued observation, not
promotion: advisory fast proof, scoped coverage, mutation, coverage telemetry,
and Codecov upload remain non-required until a future maintainer decision cites
fresh verified decision evidence and changes checked policy deliberately.

Manual proof-observation collector run `25917845086` on `main` passed on
2026-05-15 after ADR-0009 merged. It produced
`proof-observation-decision.json` with schema
`tokmd.proof_observation_decision.v1`, `ok = true`, 3 source artifacts, 100
advisory observations, 38 selected/executed/passed advisory commands, 38
artifacts, and 11 scopes. Its `proof-observation-decision-check.json` reported
schema `tokmd.proof_observation_decision_check.v1`, `ok = true`, 5 criteria
met, and 2 criteria missing (`affected_present` and
`required_proof_observed`). That confirms the collector can now upload the
verified aggregate while preserving the advisory boundary.

The CI risk-pack output ownership slice is closed. PR #2281 replaced the CI
detect job's inline Bash path classifier with Rust-owned
`cargo xtask ci-plan --github-output`, while preserving existing
`needs.detect.outputs.*` names, job selection behavior, required-check status,
proof advisory boundaries, and public `ci-plan.json` compatibility. Hosted PR
checks and post-merge main CI passed.

The proof artifact check receipt slice is closed. PR #2283 made
`proof-artifacts-check`, `proof-execution-artifacts-check`, and
`proof-run-artifacts-check` optionally write Rust-owned JSON verifier receipts,
and the workflows now upload those receipts alongside the original proof
artifacts. The slice preserved required-check behavior, advisory proof status,
Codecov defaults, public `tokmd` CLI behavior, and source proof artifact
schemas. There is no active proof-orchestration implementation slice; choose
the next lane deliberately from fresh evidence.

The code-intelligence platform audit is closed. It mapped the broad platform
objective to live artifacts and verifier coverage, did not mark the platform
complete as a single finished program, and selected publishing evidence
readiness as the next plan-first lane.

The active lane is now publishing evidence readiness. The plan in
`docs/plans/publishing-evidence-readiness.md` should make release and
publishing facts easier to consume without publishing crates, tagging releases,
changing release workflow behavior, changing public receipt schemas, or
promoting advisory proof.

The first publishing evidence contract is now recorded in
`docs/specs/publishing-evidence.md`. Current publishing evidence uses
`cargo xtask publish-surface --json --verify-publish` as the first
machine-readable package-surface artifact and maps version consistency,
release metadata proof routing, CI lane whitelist entries, CI planning, and the
release workflow to their existing evidence. A wrapper receipt is deferred
until a consumer proves the need.

## Next Work Packets

1. Add the user-facing publishing evidence guide from the active plan; do not
   change release behavior before the human workflow is clear.
2. Do not reopen AST productization without a fresh proposal grounded in the
   shadow evidence.
3. Choose the next proof-orchestration slice deliberately; do not promote
   advisory proof, default Codecov upload, or cockpit/handoff consumption from
   the closed decision-readiness lane.
4. Fix cockpit review-packet and Action-hosting gaps only when fresh evidence
   shows a product, verifier, or hosted-comment issue.
5. Preserve `tokmd cockpit` as the review evidence implementation surface until
   a separate review orchestrator has a real contract.
6. Continue architecture consolidation in batches, preserving `ci/proof.toml`
   scope granularity as implementation microcrates collapse into SRP modules.
7. Use bounded performance timing receipts before optimizing hot paths.
8. Keep source-of-truth docs, active goal state, and proof-policy routing
   aligned as new lanes start; do not reopen the doc-artifacts checker lane
   unless the spec changes.
9. Keep product-readiness docs aligned as workflows change, but start any new
   product lane from a fresh plan rather than extending the completed first-pass
   user-path cleanup by inertia.
10. Keep AST foundation work in shadow mode until comparison evidence justifies
   any public receipt or default behavior change.

## Directional Rules

- `tokmd-config` is retired. It must remain forbidden by policy, with ownership in `tokmd-settings`, `tokmd-core`, and `tokmd`.
- `.jules` is an allowed knowledge workspace for durable specs, investigations, friction notes, persona learnings, runbooks, ledgers, envelopes, and generated indexes.
- Coverage remains advisory telemetry until maintainers intentionally promote it to a gate.
- Fast proof-run and scoped coverage observations remain advisory until maintainers intentionally promote them.
- Cockpit remains the current PR-review evidence surface until a separate review command has a distinct artifact contract.

## Checkpoints

- Dependency-boundary checks now read `ci/proof.toml` while preserving the existing sorted `tokmd-analysis*` manifest scan and `dependencies` / `dev-dependencies` / `build-dependencies` coverage.
- Fixture-blob checks now read `ci/proof.toml` while preserving the existing crypto extension and marker detection plus the `.claude`, `.jules`, `vendor`, proof-policy source, and checker-source allowlist behavior.
- `cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json` now maps changed files to proof scopes from `ci/proof.toml`, reports unknown files, and keeps non-Rust unknown handling policy-driven.
- `cargo xtask affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --json-output <path>` now writes the same `tokmd.affected.v1` report as a Rust-owned JSON artifact, so CI and handoff workflows do not need shell redirection to capture `affected.json`.
- `cargo xtask proof --profile affected --base origin/main --head HEAD --plan` now prints a stable proof plan without running commands; `fast`, `release`, and `deep` profiles are plan-only placeholders for the next CI integration slices.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --plan-json <path>` now writes the same `tokmd.proof_plan.v1` report as a Rust-owned JSON artifact, so CI and handoff workflows do not need to rely on shell redirection to capture `proof-plan.json`.
- CI now validates `cargo xtask proof-policy --check` as part of the required aggregate and uploads PR-only affected proof artifacts while keeping existing jobs authoritative.
- The proof scope registry now covers first-class product/control-plane surfaces for CLI, gate, cockpit, WASM, browser runner, the composite GitHub Action, schema contracts, and the proof control plane.
- Release, mutation, Nix validation, and label-sync workflows now have explicit proof-scope routing so Dependabot or workflow-only action updates do not fail affected planning as unknown files before they reach their relevant release, policy, or documentation proof.
- Clippy policy now has a governed ledger and `cargo xtask check-lint-policy` check while keeping the repository MSRV at 1.92 and leaving crate-wide lint inheritance as a later cleanup stack.
- Analysis and formatting module scopes now route `tokmd-analysis`, `tokmd-analysis-types`, and `tokmd-format` changes to targeted package, snapshot, renderer, and module proof commands.
- Affected proof plans now include advisory scoped coverage and mutation commands derived from matched scope metadata while leaving existing proof commands required and CI behavior unchanged.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --summary-md <path>` now writes a Markdown proof-plan artifact, and the informational PR affected-plan job appends that Rust-generated summary while keeping existing CI jobs authoritative.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --evidence-json <path>` now writes a machine-readable planned-evidence artifact for scoped coverage and mutation commands. The artifact records `planned` / `not_executed` status and zero executed counts so consumers do not confuse planned advisory evidence with passing evidence.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --executor-summary <path>` now writes an informational coverage-only executor summary prototype. It selects non-required coverage commands, records them as skipped with `tool_execution_not_enabled`, and does not invoke `cargo llvm-cov`.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --executor-summary <path> --executor-mode dry-run` now exercises the executor selection boundary for at most one non-required coverage command without invoking `cargo llvm-cov`.
- Executor summaries now include an `execution_guard` block. CI evidence execution remains disabled unless a future workflow explicitly passes `--allow-ci-evidence-execution`, and current executor modes still report zero executed commands.
- Rust-generated proof-plan Markdown now surfaces executor guard status whenever an executor summary is requested, so the affected-plan CI summary shows whether planner-selected evidence execution is blocked or explicitly opted in.
- `ci/proof.toml` now declares the first executor promotion rule: coverage is the only supported executor family, CI execution requires explicit opt-in, and dry-run selection is policy-limited before any CI job can execute planner-selected evidence commands.
- `cargo xtask proof-policy --check` and `--json` now report the active executor policy rule alongside scope, allowlist, fixture blob, and dependency-boundary counts.
- `cargo xtask proof-policy --json-output <path>` now writes the same `tokmd.proof_policy.v1` report as a Rust-owned JSON artifact, so CI proof-run, proof-executor, and observation-collection workflows do not need shell redirection to capture `proof-policy.json`.
- `cargo xtask proof --plan --executor-manifest <path>` now writes a planner-selected executor command manifest with the executor policy, guard status, selection rule, stable command ids, and zero executed counts.
- The PR-only affected-plan CI artifact job now writes and uploads `executor-manifest.json` alongside `affected.json`, `proof-plan.json`, `proof-evidence.json`, `executor-summary.json`, and `proof-plan.md`, without opting into executor command execution.
- `cargo xtask proof-artifacts-check` now verifies executor summary/manifest consistency without executing planned commands, including schema, guard, count, and command-entry drift checks.
- The PR-only affected-plan CI artifact job now runs `cargo xtask proof-artifacts-check` after artifact generation, records its status, and uploads the verifier output while remaining informational.
- The affected-plan CI job now fails on affected-scope generation, proof-plan generation, or proof artifact verifier failure, while executor command execution remains disabled and existing proof commands remain separately authoritative.
- The proof scope registry now classifies model/scan path-normalization changes and `.jules` provenance updates so generated knowledge artifacts and core path hot-path work do not appear as unknown files in affected plans.
- No-panic policy now has a governed allowlist (`policy/no-panic-allowlist.toml`, schema 0.3) and a semantic checker (`cargo xtask check-no-panic-family`). Identity is `path + family + selector` so reformatting source files does not invalidate receipts. Default mode is advisory: schema/shape, expired entries, and stale entries block; unallowlisted findings are reported only. `cargo xtask no-panic-propose` writes proposed allowlist entries to `target/no-panic-proposed-allowlist.toml`. The strict (blocking) flip is staged behind member-crate `[lints] workspace = true` adoption and a panic-family debt burn-down.
- `cargo xtask check-no-panic-family --json-output <path>` now writes the same semantic no-panic report as a Rust-owned JSON artifact, so the no-panic policy workflow does not need shell redirection to capture `no-panic-report.json`.
- Workspace dependency graph changes now have an explicit proof scope for root/workspace manifests and `Cargo.lock`, routing affected plans to deny, dependency-boundary, and publish-surface checks instead of leaving lockfile-only changes unknown.
- Fuzz harness changes now have an explicit proof scope for `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`, `fuzz/Cargo.toml`, targets, dictionaries, corpora, and harness docs, routing affected plans to the fuzz harness inventory check before deeper fuzz execution is promoted.
- The proof executor now has a deliberately opt-in local coverage execution experiment. `--executor-mode execute` cannot be combined with `--plan`, requires explicit local or CI opt-in, runs only planner-selected non-required coverage commands, and writes executor summary/manifest artifacts while required proof jobs remain authoritative.
- `cargo xtask proof-artifacts-check` now allows enabled execution guards for non-executed artifacts; this verifier still rejects executed artifacts by `execution_status` and executed counts until an execution verifier lands.
- `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check` now verifies opted-in executed executor artifacts separately from the no-execution verifier, requiring executed status, an enabled guard, zero failed commands, and matching summary/manifest command records.
- `.github/workflows/proof-executor.yml` now provides a scoped coverage executor experiment for manual dispatch and non-required PR runs. It runs planner-selected non-required coverage commands with explicit CI opt-in, verifies executed artifacts, uploads proof artifacts, and leaves required PR proof jobs unchanged.
- Manual proof-executor run `25464543145` on `main` passed on 2026-05-06. It verified the workflow-dispatch no-diff path: `affected_status=0`, `executor_status=0`, `verifier_status=0`, `execution_guard.reason=ci_explicit_opt_in_enabled`, and zero selected/executed commands.
- Manual proof-executor run `25465495509` on a disposable branch passed on 2026-05-06. It matched `crates/tokmd-core/tests/ffi_parity_w53.rs` to `tokmd_core_ffi`, selected one advisory coverage command, executed it with `exit_code=0`, produced `target/proof/coverage/tokmd_core_ffi.lcov`, and passed `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check`.
- The proof executor workflow now runs on pull requests as `Scoped Coverage Executor (Non-Required)`. It remains outside the required CI aggregate, executes only planner-selected non-required coverage commands, keeps Codecov upload manual-only, and leaves existing proof jobs authoritative.
- `tokmd cockpit --review-packet-dir <dir>` now emits the cockpit review packet while leaving default stdout and the existing `--artifacts-dir` director contract unchanged.
- The cockpit review packet now includes `review-map.json` / `review-map.md` generated from the existing cockpit `review_plan`, giving packet consumers a stable prioritized review map without introducing a separate `tokmd review` command.
- The composite GitHub Action now exposes an opt-in cockpit `review-packet` input. In `mode: cockpit`, `review-packet: true` writes `.tokmd/review`, exposes it as the `review-packet` output, keeps `.tokmd/review/comment.md` as the packet-local summary output, and prepares `tokmd-review-packet-comment.md` for optional hosted pull request comments when metadata is added.
- The composite Action self-test now exercises `mode: cockpit`, `review-packet: true`, `artifact: true`, and `comment: false` together, proving packet artifact upload stays independent from pull request commenting.
- `tokmd_core::cockpit_workflow` now has a feature-gated contract test against a real temporary git repo, and the cockpit proof scope routes that facade test through the affected proof plan.
- Cockpit `comment.md` now includes compact evidence availability counts so missing, degraded, stale, skipped, or unavailable evidence is visible in the PR-comment-ready artifact, not only in packet JSON.
- Browser worker protocol v2 now emits run progress messages for in-memory worker execution. Worker runs produce `start`, `fetch`, optional `analyze`, `done`, and `error` progress phases while keeping cancellation explicitly unavailable.
- The browser runner UI now displays worker-run progress in a dedicated run-progress panel, while preserving the latest successful result during later repo-load or worker-run progress updates.
- Browser runner terminal worker messages now follow the same active-request guard as progress messages, so stale `result` or `error` events from an older run cannot overwrite a newer run's UI state.
- Browser runner GitHub token UX now uses session-only storage, shows anonymous/authenticated state without exposing the raw token, and provides an explicit clear-token action.
- Browser runner GitHub token UX now marks rejected tokens after GitHub auth/access failures, surfaces update-or-clear guidance, and keeps raw token text out of logs and status output.
- Browser GitHub ingest now surfaces numeric or HTTP-date `Retry-After` guidance in the UI and enables a manual retry action only for retryable GitHub rate-limit failures.
- Browser worker mode and preset reporting now reads the `tokmd-wasm` capability payload when present and intersects it with actual exported entrypoints, so the UI and runtime validation do not promise modes the loaded bundle cannot execute.
- Browser runner mode controls now consume that loaded worker capability surface: unavailable modes are disabled, unsupported current selections are switched to the first supported mode, and analyze sample args choose a preset advertised by the loaded bundle.
- Browser runner GitHub repo-load args now use that same loaded-bundle analyze preset fallback, so a bundle that advertises only `receipt` does not receive a synthetic `estimate` preset after inputs are loaded.
- Browser runner local file selection now fills the existing ordered in-memory `inputs` payload without GitHub fetch, token state, or cache sharing, preserving the latest successful result while users stage local browser-safe runs.
- The cockpit review packet manifest now carries evidence availability counts and gate-id capability groups linked to `evidence.json#/gates`, so packet consumers can see unavailable or degraded evidence without parsing the full cockpit receipt.
- `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check` now verifies that executed entries with declared artifact paths point at existing, non-empty files, so a passing executor command cannot claim missing LCOV evidence.
- Executed coverage artifacts now must be LCOV-shaped text with `SF:` and `end_of_record` records before `proof-execution-artifacts-check` accepts them.
- `cargo xtask proof-execution-observation` now turns verified executed summary/manifest pairs into `proof-executor-observation.json`, a compact cross-PR observation artifact for collecting non-required executor runs without promoting them to required gates or default Codecov uploads.
- `cargo xtask proof-execution-observations-summary --observation <path>...` now summarizes downloaded executor observation artifacts by family, scope, and source-run window, giving maintainers a Rust-owned collection view before any required-gate or default Codecov-upload promotion. It also accepts `--observations-dir <dir>` to recursively collect `proof-executor-observation.json` artifacts from downloaded GitHub run directories, and `--source-runs-json <path>` to report expected, observed, missing, and unmatched executor-run artifacts from the saved `gh run list` window.
- The proof executor workflow now uploads `proof-executor-observation-collection.json` alongside the per-run observation by running the Rust-owned observation summary command over `target/proof`.
- `cargo xtask proof --run-required --allow-local-required-execution --proof-run-summary <path>` now provides the first opt-in required proof-command runner. It executes only required commands from the proof plan, excludes advisory coverage/mutation commands, writes `tokmd.proof_run_summary.v1`, and still leaves CI/default invocations in plan-only mode unless a future workflow explicitly opts into required execution.
- `cargo xtask proof-run-artifacts-check --proof-run-summary <path>` now verifies required proof-run summaries before workflow adoption: schema, enabled local/CI guard, zero failed commands, empty unknown files, count consistency, and required-only passed entries.
- CI now runs `Fast Proof Run (Advisory)` on pull requests, which executes `cargo xtask proof --profile fast --run-required --allow-ci-required-execution`, verifies `tokmd.proof_run_summary.v1`, uploads `fast-proof-run` artifacts, and deliberately stays outside the required aggregate while existing jobs remain authoritative.
- `ci/proof.toml` now owns the advisory PR fast proof-run defaults under `[proof_run.pr]`: `profile = "fast"`, `default_enabled = true`, `required = false`, and `artifact_name = "fast-proof-run"`. CI resolves those checked defaults before running the advisory job.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now resolves `[proof_run.pr]` with `cargo xtask proof-run-pr-policy`, writing `proof-run-pr.outputs` from the checked proof-policy JSON before the advisory Fast Proof Run job executes. The workflow still stays outside the required aggregate; Rust owns the default-enabled/non-required/profile/artifact-name invariants.
- `cargo xtask proof-run-observation --proof-run-summary <path> --output <path>` now writes `tokmd.proof_run_observation.v1`, a compact observation artifact derived from a verified required proof-run summary. The advisory Fast Proof Run CI job uploads it alongside `proof-run-summary.json`.
- `cargo xtask proof-run-observations-summary --observation <path>...` now summarizes downloaded fast proof-run observation artifacts by profile, scope, guard reason, and source-run window. This gives maintainers Rust-owned visibility into routine PR fast-proof observations without promoting the advisory job into the required aggregate.
- Fast proof-run observation collection over PR CI run `25522285718` passed on 2026-05-07 after #1756 merged. The collection recorded 1 observed run, 0 missing runs, 4 required/executed/passed commands, 0 failed commands, and 4 scopes: `boundaries`, `fixture_blobs`, `proof_policy`, and `workspace`. The guard reason was `ci_explicit_required_opt_in_enabled`, and the advisory job remains outside the required aggregate.
- Observation collection can now enforce readiness thresholds with `--min-observations`, `--min-executed`, `--min-scopes`, and `--min-artifacts`, so downloaded non-required executor runs can prove a multi-run/multi-scope evidence floor before any promotion decision.
- Observation collection can now also write `--summary-md`, and the proof executor workflow appends that Rust-generated Markdown collection report to the GitHub job summary while still uploading the JSON artifact.
- `cargo xtask proof` now accepts `--executor-max-commands <n>` as a positive override for the policy-selected advisory executor command limit. The proof executor workflow keeps PR runs at a small policy-backed command limit by default, while manual dispatches can raise `max_evidence_commands` to collect multi-scope evidence without changing required gates.
- `.github/workflows/proof-observation-collection.yml` now provides a manual collector for successful `proof-executor.yml` runs. It saves the successful-run list as `target/proof-observations/runs.json`, downloads prior `proof-executor-artifacts`, runs the Rust-owned observation collection thresholds over the downloaded artifacts and source-run window, uploads the collection, and appends the Markdown collection summary without executing new evidence commands. The default collector floor requires an observation artifact but not executed commands/scopes/artifacts yet, so maintainers can record the current evidence floor before choosing stricter promotion thresholds.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25487797962` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07. It downloaded 11 successful proof-executor observations and recorded the current floor: 11 observations, zero selected/executed/passed commands, zero scopes, and zero artifacts. That proves the collector path while confirming that stricter promotion thresholds need intentionally collected coverage-enabled observations first.
- Manual proof-executor run `25489053208` on disposable branch `codex/proof-executor-coverage-sample` passed on 2026-05-07. It changed `crates/tokmd-core/tests/ffi_parity_w53.rs` and `crates/tokmd-format/src/redact/mod.rs`, selected two non-required coverage commands, executed/passed both, and produced two LCOV artifacts for `tokmd_core_ffi` and `format_redaction_scan_args`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25489377912` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 with stricter thresholds: `--min-observations 1`, `--min-executed 2`, `--min-scopes 2`, and `--min-artifacts 2`. The collection recorded 19 observations total, with 2 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 2 covered scopes, and 2 artifacts.
- `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check` now resolves downloaded executor artifacts without manually reconstructing `target/proof`: it still honors workflow-relative paths as written, and also resolves `target/proof/...` artifact paths against the downloaded artifact root. The downloaded artifacts from run `25489053208` now re-verify locally with 2 executed commands and guard `ci_explicit_opt_in_enabled`.
- Advisory Codecov coverage now has README visibility, documented lane boundaries in `docs/ci/coverage.md`, proof-control-plane routing for `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`, `codecov.yml`, and the coverage docs, plus a narrow `project_readme` scope so README-only edits route to docs checks instead of unknown-file failures. Coverage remains telemetry, not a ratchet or required gate.
- `cargo xtask coverage-receipt` now emits `tokmd.coverage_receipt.v1` for `coverage.json`, `coverage.txt`, and `lcov.info`, and the coverage workflow uploads `target/coverage/coverage-receipt.json` with the coverage artifacts. The receipt records coverage artifact presence and byte counts without making coverage a required gate.
- Codecov project and patch statuses remain informational during the baseline phase, and coverage receipt generation is owned by `cargo xtask coverage-receipt` rather than a duplicate workflow heredoc.
- `cargo xtask ci-actuals` now emits `tokmd.ci_actuals.v1` from a GitHub Actions `needs` payload plus optional timing sidecar data. Missing timing is recorded as missing rather than zero so later budget and learned-estimate work can consume the receipt without inventing measurements.
- Top-level project truth docs (`ROADMAP.md`, ADRs, architecture, design, implementation plan, requirements, and specification) now have a proof-policy scope that routes changes to `cargo xtask docs --check` instead of leaving architecture-doc-only fixes as unknown files.
- The external-service policy now reflects the active safe Droid integration:
  Factory Droid is approved only through the pinned safe action wrapper,
  requires `FACTORY_API_KEY` and `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, skips fork PR auto-review,
  restricts manual `@droid` commands to trusted actors, and keeps raw debug
  artifact upload disabled.
- Manual proof-executor run `25499361375` on disposable branch `codex/proof-executor-more-scope-sample` passed on 2026-05-07. It changed `crates/tokmd-analysis/src/complexity/mod.rs` and `crates/tokmd-gate/src/pointer.rs`, matched `analysis_complexity` and `tokmd_gate`, selected and executed two non-required coverage commands, produced `analysis_complexity.lcov` and `tokmd_gate.lcov`, and re-verified locally with `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25499876871` on `main` intentionally failed the stricter four-scope floor under a last-30 successful-run window: the collector found enough executed commands and artifacts, but only 3 distinct scopes. That is useful negative evidence that promotion thresholds need a recency/window rule, not just aggregate historical totals.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25499968322` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 with `--run-limit 100`, `--min-observations 1`, `--min-executed 4`, `--min-scopes 4`, and `--min-artifacts 4`. The collection recorded 54 observations, 8 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 8 artifacts, and 5 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`.
- `ci/proof.toml` now records checked scoped coverage executor promotion criteria under `[executor.promotion]`: `window = "last_successful_runs"`, `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, `min_artifacts = 4`, `min_passing_collector_runs = 1`, `required_gate = false`, and `default_codecov_upload = false`. `cargo xtask proof-policy --check` validates the window/thresholds and rejects required-gate or default Codecov-upload promotion until those behaviors are implemented intentionally.
- `.github/workflows/proof-observation-collection.yml` now resolves blank manual collector thresholds from checked `[executor.promotion]` policy with `cargo xtask proof-policy --json-output` plus `cargo xtask proof-observation-thresholds`, writes the resolved `thresholds.env` into the uploaded artifact, and shows whether each threshold came from `ci/proof.toml` or a workflow-dispatch override. The executor remains non-required, and Codecov upload remains manual-only.
- `.github/workflows/proof-observation-collection.yml` now derives `run-ids.txt` from the saved `runs.json` source-run window with `cargo xtask proof-observation-run-ids`, keeping run-id extraction Rust-owned while leaving the external `gh run list` fetch as the GitHub Actions boundary.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25502593070` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 using blank workflow-dispatch inputs after #1727 merged. The workflow resolved `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, and `min_artifacts = 4` from `ci/proof.toml`; the collection recorded 58 observations, 8 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 8 artifacts, and 5 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`.
- `[executor.promotion]` now makes the recency window explicit with `window = "last_successful_runs"`; `cargo xtask proof-policy --json` reports it and validation rejects promotion blocks without a window. This preserves the current last-100 collector floor while keeping the earlier last-30 failure visible as evidence that window size is a policy decision, not an implicit workflow default.
- `[executor.promotion]` now records `min_passing_collector_runs = 1` as a promotion precondition, so a future required-gate or default Codecov-upload flip must cite at least one recent passing manual collector run in addition to the executor observation thresholds.
- The manual observation collector now emits `proof-executor-promotion-readiness.json` with schema `tokmd.proof_executor_promotion_readiness.v1`. The receipt verifies the policy-backed observation thresholds plus `min_passing_collector_runs` from recent successful `proof-observation-collection.yml` GitHub run history.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25505861187` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 using blank workflow-dispatch inputs after #1731 merged. The workflow resolved `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, `min_artifacts = 4`, and `min_passing_collector_runs = 1` from `ci/proof.toml`; the collection recorded 62 observations, 8 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 8 artifacts, and 5 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`. The new `proof-executor-promotion-readiness.json` receipt reported schema `tokmd.proof_executor_promotion_readiness.v1`, `ok = true`, and 1 recent passing collector run from `25502593070`.
- `[executor.pr]` now records the default-on PR executor decision directly in `ci/proof.toml`: PR observation is enabled, remains non-required, uses a small planner-selected command limit by default, and keeps Codecov upload off unless a manual workflow dispatch explicitly opts in. `.github/workflows/proof-executor.yml` resolves the command limit from `cargo xtask proof-policy --json-output` so the PR default is Rust-policy-backed rather than YAML-only.
- `.github/workflows/proof-executor.yml` now resolves `[executor.pr]` with `cargo xtask proof-executor-pr-policy`, writing `proof-executor-pr.env` from the checked proof-policy JSON plus any manual `max_evidence_commands` override. The workflow still owns only runner/env plumbing, while Rust owns the default-enabled/non-required/Codecov-off invariants and positive command-limit validation.
- PR proof-executor run `25506897630` on #1734 passed on 2026-05-07 with policy-backed PR defaults. The uploaded `proof-policy.json` recorded `[executor.pr] default_enabled = true`, `required = false`, `max_commands = 1`, and `codecov_upload = false`; all executor statuses were zero, the execution guard reason was `ci_explicit_opt_in_enabled`, and the Codecov upload step was skipped because the event was `pull_request`. The run selected zero coverage commands because #1734 touched the proof-control-plane scope, which intentionally has `coverage = false`.
- Disposable draft PR #1736 collected the first policy-backed PR executor run on a coverage-enabled scope and was closed unmerged to avoid product-scope churn. PR proof-executor run `25508000337` passed on 2026-05-07: `affected.json` mapped `crates/tokmd-core/tests/ffi_parity_w53.rs` to `tokmd_core_ffi`, the uploaded `proof-policy.json` recorded `[executor.pr] default_enabled = true`, `required = false`, `max_commands = 1`, and `codecov_upload = false`, `executor-summary.json` selected/executed/passed one non-required coverage command, `coverage/tokmd_core_ffi.lcov` was uploaded, and local verification accepted the downloaded artifacts plus a one-observation summary with 1 executed command, 1 scope, and 1 artifact. Codecov upload remained skipped because the event was `pull_request`.
- `[executor.pr]` now widens the non-required PR executor observation default to `max_commands = 2`. This keeps PR execution advisory and Codecov-off while beginning broader scoped coverage observation when a PR touches multiple coverage-enabled proof scopes.
- Disposable draft PR #1740 proved the two-command PR default and was closed unmerged to avoid product-scope churn. PR proof-executor run `25509510820` passed on 2026-05-07: `proof-policy.json` recorded `[executor.pr] default_enabled = true`, `required = false`, `max_commands = 2`, and `codecov_upload = false`; `executor-summary.json` selected/executed/passed two non-required coverage commands for `format_redaction_scan_args` and `tokmd_core_ffi`; the run uploaded `format_redaction_scan_args.lcov` and `tokmd_core_ffi.lcov`; and local verification accepted the downloaded artifacts with `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25510251689` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 after #1741 merged. The workflow resolved `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, `min_artifacts = 4`, and `min_passing_collector_runs = 1` from `ci/proof.toml`; the collection recorded 72 observations, 13 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 13 artifacts, and 5 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`. The `proof-executor-promotion-readiness.json` receipt reported schema `tokmd.proof_executor_promotion_readiness.v1`, `ok = true`, and 1 recent passing collector run from `25505861187`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25512575044` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 after #1743 and #1733 merged. The workflow resolved `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, `min_artifacts = 4`, and `min_passing_collector_runs = 1` from `ci/proof.toml`; the collection recorded 75 observations, 15 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 15 artifacts, and 6 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `analysis_content_assets`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`. The `proof-executor-promotion-readiness.json` receipt reported schema `tokmd.proof_executor_promotion_readiness.v1`, `ok = true`, and 1 recent passing collector run from `25510251689`.
- PR proof-executor run `25514476862` on #1748 passed on 2026-05-07 under the two-command PR default. It matched `crates/tokmd/tests/cockpit_integration.rs` to `tokmd_cockpit`, selected/executed/passed one non-required coverage command, produced `tokmd_cockpit.lcov`, and locally re-verified with `cargo xtask proof-execution-artifacts-check`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25515026895` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 after #1748 merged. The workflow resolved `run_limit = 100`, `min_observations = 1`, `min_executed = 4`, `min_scopes = 4`, `min_artifacts = 4`, and `min_passing_collector_runs = 1` from `ci/proof.toml`; the collection recorded 80 observations, 16 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 16 artifacts, and 7 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `analysis_content_assets`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_cockpit`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`. The `proof-executor-promotion-readiness.json` receipt reported schema `tokmd.proof_executor_promotion_readiness.v1`, `ok = true`, and 1 recent passing collector run from `25512575044`.
- Manual proof-observation collector run `25516861742` on `main` passed on 2026-05-07 after #1750 merged. The collection recorded 82 observations, 16 selected/executed/passed coverage commands, 16 artifacts, and 7 distinct scopes: `analysis_complexity`, `analysis_content_assets`, `format_redaction_scan_args`, `tokmd_cli`, `tokmd_cockpit`, `tokmd_core_ffi`, and `tokmd_gate`. The new source-run window accounting reported `expected_runs = 99`, `observed_runs = 82`, `missing_runs = 17`, and `unmatched_observations = 0`, proving the collector can distinguish successful executor runs that lacked downloadable observation artifacts from observations outside the saved run window.
- Proof-control-plane status: routine PR observations continue under the two-command default. There is no active promotion slice for a required gate, default Codecov upload, or larger command-limit default.
- `cargo xtask perf-smoke --target-repo <path> --output target/perf/perf-smoke.json` now emits `tokmd.perf_smoke.v1`, an opt-in measurement receipt for core `lang`, `module`, and `export` workflows. Receipt schema version 2 also supports repeatable `--analysis-preset <name>` timings with bounded file, byte, and git limits so content/near-dup analysis lanes can collect measurement evidence before optimization work. The receipt records row and language counts while redacting raw target paths.
- The documentation source-of-truth lane now has a draft doc-artifact contract in `docs/specs/doc-artifacts.md` and an active implementation plan in `docs/plans/doc-artifacts-check.md` for `cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check`. The checker verifies artifact shape, links, and routing without changing product behavior, proof promotion, Codecov defaults, or product receipt schemas.
- `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` now captures the draft source-of-truth artifact families, allowed statuses, required sections, active-goal schema, link rules, and optional `tokmd.doc_artifacts_check.v1` receipt schema that `cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check` consumes. The policy remains documentation-control-plane configuration; it does not promote proof gates or Codecov defaults.
- `cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check` now validates the source-of-truth artifact policy, required docs, active-goal links, doc family status values, ADR filenames, and required sections. `cargo xtask docs --check` now calls the checker after generated reference documentation is verified, keeping source-of-truth validation in the docs lane without changing product behavior.
- `cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check --json <path>` now writes a visibility-only `tokmd.doc_artifacts_check.v1` receipt with checked counts and errors for CI artifacts, review packets, or later evidencebus consumers. Text output remains the default.
- CI Docs Check now uploads the visibility-only `doc-artifacts-check` artifact from `target/docs/doc-artifacts-check.json`, so source-of-truth validation has a reviewable receipt without changing proof promotion, Codecov defaults, or product behavior.
- `ci/proof.toml` now maps source-of-truth docs, templates, `.jules/goals/**`, `policy/doc-artifacts.toml`, and doc-artifacts checker code into the `doc_artifacts_policy` scope, so affected proof selects the doc-artifacts checker whenever the source-of-truth stack changes.
- `docs/agent-workflows/source-of-truth.md` now gives maintainers and coding agents an operational checklist for reading `docs/NEXT.md`, `.jules/goals/active.toml`, linked plans/specs/ADRs, policy files, and proof output before changing a lane.
- `.jules/goals/archive/README.md` now defines how completed, paused, or superseded active goals can be archived as historical snapshots without turning archives into a second active queue.
- `tokmd cockpit --doc-artifacts-check <path> --review-packet-dir <dir>` now imports the visibility-only `tokmd.doc_artifacts_check.v1` receipt into review packets, copies it to `docs/doc-artifacts-check.json`, records it in `manifest.json` and `evidence.json`, and summarizes it in `review-map.md` / `comment.md` without changing merge behavior, proof promotion, or Codecov defaults.
- The documentation source-of-truth lane is closed through first enforcement:
  `docs/plans/doc-artifacts-check.md` is complete, the completed goal is
  archived in `.jules/goals/archive/2026-05-13-doc-artifacts-check.toml`, and
  `.jules/goals/active.toml` now points at cockpit review usefulness.
- The cockpit review packet comment now points directly to `evidence.json`, `review-map.md`, and `cockpit.json`, so hosted PR comments have a short path from the summary to the full packet artifacts.
- Cockpit review-packet evidence availability now uses the `missing` bucket for pending gates with relevant scope but no tested scope, keeping absent optional gates separate as `unavailable`.
- The composite Action now adds hosted packet metadata to review-packet PR comments, pointing reviewers to the workflow run, `tokmd-receipts` artifact, and `.tokmd/review` packet path when artifacts are uploaded.
- The composite Action now prepares hosted review-packet comments in `tokmd-review-packet-comment.md` instead of mutating `.tokmd/review/comment.md`, preserving `manifest.json` hashes for packet-local artifacts while keeping hosted PR comments useful.
- The composite Action self-test now runs `cargo xtask review-packet-check --dir .tokmd/review` after preparing the hosted comment copy, proving Action-hosted metadata does not drift packet-local manifest hashes.
- `cargo xtask review-packet-check --dir <dir> --json <path>` now emits a
  `tokmd.review_packet_check.v1` verifier receipt with schema, artifact, hash,
  and packet-local path evidence for CI upload or downstream inspection.
- The composite Action now writes `target/tokmd/review-packet-check.json` for
  cockpit review packets after preparing the hosted comment copy and uploads it
  with `tokmd-receipts` when artifact upload is enabled.
- Hosted review-packet comments now show verifier status, manifest hash status,
  and compact proof evidence counts while keeping packet-local `comment.md`
  immutable after manifest hashing.
- Cockpit review maps now order packet items for review-first use by preserving
  source-of-truth changes first, then missing/stale/degraded evidence,
  high-complexity items, and contract paths, while keeping
  `cockpit.json#/review_plan/<index>` refs pointed at the original receipt
  order.
- `docs/cockpit-proof-evidence.md` now includes the maintainer-facing local
  workflow for planning proof, optionally executing guarded required proof,
  importing proof artifacts, and verifying the review packet.
- `docs/evidencebus-integration.md` now maps verified tokmd review packets to
  evidencebus producer inputs, preserving the boundary that tokmd emits code
  evidence while evidencebus validates, inventories, bundles, and exports
  cross-tool evidence.
- `tokmd handoff` now accepts optional `--review-packet-dir`,
  `--review-packet-check`, `--affected`, and `--proof-plan` inputs and writes
  packet-local `review-links.json` / `proof-links.json` artifacts with BLAKE3
  hashes in `manifest.json`. These artifacts link adjacent review and proof
  receipts for agent workflows; they do not copy or verify the external
  receipts.
- `tokmd handoff` now emits `work-order.md` as a BLAKE3-hashed handoff
  artifact. It gives coding agents an ordered consumption map, selected-file
  summary, linked review/proof evidence handles, and guardrails while leaving
  external receipt verification to the review-packet and proof verifiers.
- Cockpit `review-map.json` and `review-map.md` now surface packet-level evidence counts and item-level evidence status, so maintainers can see what proof is present or missing while deciding what to review first.
- Cockpit review packets now keep imported proof artifacts packet-local under
  `.tokmd/review/proof/*.json`, list those artifacts in `manifest.json`, and
  link direct changed-file matches from `review-map.json` items to
  `evidence.json#/proof/*` plus the copied source proof artifact. Review-map
  Markdown now renders direct changed-file proof matches with required/advisory,
  execution, availability, freshness, command, and proof-reference lines.
  Packet-local `comment.md` now includes compact proof evidence totals for
  required/advisory proof and freshness without listing raw command output.
- Cockpit `review-map.md` now also renders a packet-level imported-proof
  overview, so coverage receipts or other proof artifacts that apply at packet
  scope remain visible to reviewers even when they do not directly match a
  changed review-map item.
- Architecture consolidation now has a current-state batch plan in
  `docs/architecture-consolidation-plan.md`, grounded in the live
  publish-surface verifier, large-file inventory, and `ci/proof.toml` scopes.
- The architecture-consolidation plan now reflects the live context-packing and
  derived-analysis owner-module state: context selection/render/manifest/output
  owners are already split, and derived analysis has coherent distribution,
  integrity, ratio, file-metrics, and language-composition owners.
- `tokmd-types` now has a dedicated context/handoff DTO owner module while
  keeping root-level public re-exports, schema versions, and serde receipt
  behavior stable. The `tokmd_context_handoff` and `schema_contracts` proof
  scopes both route the new owner file to targeted context/handoff and schema
  checks.
- Cockpit's Rust complexity gate now delegates function-scoped source analysis
  to `tokmd-analysis::source_complexity` instead of owning a duplicate parser.
  The `else if` double-count is fixed as a correctness improvement; impact
  analysis over 183 current relevant Rust source files found 52 files near the
  10-20 complexity range and 0 files flipping from fail to pass at threshold 15.
- Agent-facing architecture docs now reflect the current crate-and-module
  ownership model: analysis rendering lives in `tokmd-format`, review evidence
  in `tokmd-cockpit`, and implementation details should stay as SRP owner
  modules unless they are durable public surfaces.
- Product truth docs now distinguish tokmd's role from the wider Effortless
  Metrics evidence stack: tokmd is the deterministic code-intelligence and
  review-receipt producer, while evidencebus remains the schema-first evidence
  backplane for cross-tool validation, inventory, bundling, and export.
- Cockpit proof-evidence import now has a docs-only contract in
  `docs/cockpit-proof-evidence.md`, defining accepted proof artifacts,
  required/advisory classification, commit freshness, rendering expectations,
  and explicit non-goals before any CLI/API import surface is added.
- Roadmap-era implementation notes now distinguish historical microcrate
  extraction from the current owner-module consolidation shape, so future
  architecture work starts from the actual crate graph instead of retired
  package names.
- ADR-0008 now defines the AST foundation as feature-gated, Rust-first, and
  shadow-mode-only until real comparison evidence justifies schema or default
  metric changes.
- The first `tokmd-analysis` AST scaffold now exists behind the `ast` feature
  with shadow-only capability metadata, stable shadow artifact names, and a
  dedicated proof-policy scope. It adds no parser dependency and changes no
  default receipts.
- The Rust AST shadow scaffold now uses optional `tree-sitter` /
  `tree-sitter-rust` dependencies behind the `ast` feature to parse
  deterministic Rust function landmarks. It still emits no default receipt
  changes and does not expose browser/WASM AST capability.
