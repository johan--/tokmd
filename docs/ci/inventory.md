## Risk-gated / expensive lanes

| Lane ID | Job | Runner | Base LEM | Trigger |
|---------|-----|--------|----------|---------|
| `build_test_windows` | Build & Test (Windows) | Windows | 20 | push, `windows`, `full-ci`, or Windows path risk. |

| `rust_coverage` | Codecov Coverage | ubuntu | 30 | push, workflow dispatch, `coverage`, or `full-ci`. |

## Conditional routed implementation lanes

These lanes are listed in the whitelist for ownership and evidence tracking,
but they are mutually exclusive at runtime. PR Plan counts the route selector
and aggregate result lane by default instead of summing every skipped target.

| Lane ID | Job | Runner | Base LEM | Trigger |
|---------|-----|--------|----------|---------|
| `tokmd_rust_small_cpx42` | Tokmd Rust Small on CPX42 | em-ci-small | 12 | selected by routed Rust Small. |
| `tokmd_rust_small_cx43` | Tokmd Rust Small on CX43 | em-ci-small | 12 | selected by routed Rust Small. |
| `tokmd_rust_small_cx53` | Tokmd Rust Small on CX53 | em-ci-small | 12 | selected by routed Rust Small. |
| `tokmd_rust_small_github` | Tokmd Rust Small on GitHub Hosted | ubuntu | 20 | selected by routed Rust Small fallback. |

## Push / main-only

| Lane ID | Job | Runner | Base LEM | Notes |
|---------|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| `build_macos_push` | Build & Test (macOS) | macOS | 60 | `if: github.event_name == 'push'`. |

```

Expensive Windows, WASM, Nix, mutation, proptest, and coverage lanes are now
label, path-risk, push, or dispatch routed instead of ordinary PR defaults.
Routed Rust Small implementation jobs are represented in the default estimate
by the aggregate `tokmd_rust_small_result` lane so skipped route targets do not
force a budget override.
