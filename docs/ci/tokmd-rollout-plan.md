# tokmd CI rollout plan

This file pins the rollout sequence so reviewers can see where any given PR
fits in the ladder. Every PR in this stack has the same shape:

- **Default PR LEM impact** — what the band looks like before/after.
- **Workflows touched** — which `.yml` files change.
- **Branch protection impact** — what required jobs change, if any.
- **Failure mode caught** — what proof we are buying with the change.
- **Cheaper signal considered** — what we considered and rejected.
- **Rollback path** — how to revert without losing the receipt model.
- **Commands run** — exact local verification commands.

## Non-goals

- Replacing the proof model. The receipts must still be the proof.
- Removing strict-lint posture. Clippy strictness stays.
- Removing mutation testing. It moves to calibration / nightly / labels.
- Hard-enforcing learned LEM budgets before `ci-actuals` exist.
