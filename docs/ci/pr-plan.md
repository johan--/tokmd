# PR Plan

The PR Plan job (`.github/workflows/pr-plan.yml`) emits an advisory
`ci-plan.json` for every PR. It is the source of truth for which risk
packs the change touches, which lanes will run, and the estimated LEM
band.

## How it works

1. Fetch the base ref and compute `git diff --name-only base...head`.
2. Read `policy/ci-lane-whitelist.toml` for the lane catalogue + budget.
3. Read `policy/ci-risk-packs.toml` for path → lane routing.
4. For each non-expensive `default_pr` lane: include it always.
5. For each risk pack whose paths match a changed file: include its
   `lanes`, and (if a matching label or `full-ci` is set) its
   `deep_lanes`.
6. Compute the runner-multiplied LEM estimate per lane and the total.
7. Classify the band:

   | Band | LEM range |
   |------|-----------|
   | `normal` | ≤ default_limit_lem (35) |
   | `elevated` | ≤ elevated_limit_lem (75) |
   | `high-cost` | ≤ hard_limit_lem (125) |
   | `override-required` | > hard_limit_lem |

8. Write `target/ci/ci-plan.json` and append a Markdown summary to
   `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

## Status

- **PR 08 (this PR)** — adds the planner, the workflow, and the schema.
  The plan is **advisory**: existing CI still routes via `affected proof
  plan` and the static workflow.
- **PR 12** — wires risk-pack routing into the existing workflows so
  expensive lanes only run when the plan says so.
- **PR 14** — adds the soft budget guard that warns above the elevated
  limit and fails above the hard limit.
- **PR 15** — replaces static `base_lem` with learned p50/p90/p95
  estimates from `ci-actuals.json` (PR 13).
