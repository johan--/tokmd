# No-panic policy

Tokmd treats panic-family behavior as governed engineering debt rather than a
local code-style preference. The goal is *no unreceipted panic-family behavior
in production or tests*. The policy is enforced by two complementary rails:

1. **Clippy** (rail A) catches panic-family shapes close to the code, with full
   editor and IDE feedback. Workspace-level `clippy::unwrap_used`,
   `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, `clippy::todo`,
   `clippy::unimplemented`, `clippy::unreachable`, `clippy::indexing_slicing`,
   `clippy::string_slice`, `clippy::get_unwrap`, and friends are denied. There
   are no test carveouts (`allow-unwrap-in-tests` and similar are explicitly
   forbidden).
2. **The semantic checker** (rail B), `cargo xtask check-no-panic-family`, is
   the authoritative exception mechanism. It parses every workspace `.rs` file
   with `syn`, finds panic-family expressions, and matches each finding against
   `policy/no-panic-allowlist.toml`. Stale and expired entries fail the gate in
   both modes; findings without an allowlist entry become blocking when the
   checker is run with `--strict`.

## Families

The semantic checker currently classifies the following families:

| Family             | Detected shape                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unwrap`           | method call `.unwrap()`                                       |
| `expect`           | method call `.expect(...)`                                    |
| `get_unwrap`       | method call `.get_unwrap(...)`                                |
| `panic_macro`      | macro invocation `panic!(...)`                                |
| `todo`             | macro invocation `todo!(...)`                                 |
| `unimplemented`    | macro invocation `unimplemented!(...)`                        |
| `unreachable`      | macro invocation `unreachable!(...)`                          |
| `element_indexing` | indexing expression `x[idx]` with a non-range index           |
| `range_indexing`   | indexing expression `x[a..b]`                                 |

Without type information, the semantic checker cannot prove that a range
index targets a `&str`/`String` (Clippy's `string_slice` lint does that with
type info on rail A), so range and element indexing are reported as separate
families and left to rail A for the type-narrowed call.

Assertion macros (`assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `debug_assert!`, …) are not yet
classified; making them part of the no-panic ledger is a separate decision and
requires fallible test helpers to land first.

## Identity

Every allowlist entry is keyed by

```text
identity = path + family + selector
```

where `selector` is the four-tuple `(kind, container, callee, receiver_fingerprint)`:

* `kind` — `method_call`, `macro_invocation`, or `indexing`.
* `container` — the textual name of the enclosing function (or `<top>` if at module
  scope). For methods, the impl type is included as a `Type::method` prefix.
* `callee` — the method name, the macro path, or `[]` for indexing.
* `receiver_fingerprint` — the textual form of the receiver expression, with
  whitespace collapsed.

Line and column are recorded under `[allow.last_seen]` for review only. They are
never part of the identity, so re-formatting source files does not invalidate
allowlist entries.

## Allowlist schema

```toml
schema_version = "0.3"

[[allow]]
id = "panic-0001"
path = "crates/tokmd-format/src/render.rs"
family = "unwrap"
classification = "test_helper"   # production | test_helper | fixture | tooling
owner = "format"
explanation = "Fixture setup helper; migrate to fallible fixture builder."
expires = "2026-07-01"           # ISO-8601, future date

[allow.selector]
kind = "method_call"
container = "renders_boundary_fixture"
callee = "unwrap"
receiver_fingerprint = "std::fs::read_to_string(path)"

[allow.last_seen]
line = 42
column = 17
```

## Workflow

1. Try to remove the panic-family call. The first response to a finding is
   *make it fallible*, not *receipt it*.
2. If the panic is intentional and bounded (a hard invariant, a fixture
   helper, a one-shot CLI exit), run

   ```bash
   cargo xtask no-panic-propose
   ```

   to write `target/no-panic-proposed-allowlist.toml` with selector blocks for
   every current unallowlisted finding.
3. Copy the relevant block(s) into `policy/no-panic-allowlist.toml` and fill in
   `owner`, `classification`, `explanation`, and a future `expires` date. Use
   `id = "panic-NNNN"` with a four-digit zero-padded counter that is unique
   across the file.
4. In source code, pair the entry with a narrow

   ```rust
   #[expect(
       clippy::unwrap_used,
       reason = "policy:no-panic:panic-0001 — fixture builder, expires 2026-07-01"
   )]
   ```

   so reviewers can reach the receipt from the suppression site.
5. Run `cargo xtask check-no-panic-family`. Stale entries (selector no longer
   matches a finding) and expired entries fail the gate, so removed code or
   missed expirations are caught.

## Anti-patterns

* Do not enable test carveouts in `clippy.toml`.
* Do not write `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]`; use `#[expect(...)]` with a
  non-empty `reason` and a `policy:no-panic:<id>` link.
* Do not edit `[allow.last_seen]` by hand. The checker treats it as advisory.
* Do not rely on path+line+column identity. Selector identity is path + family
  + (kind, container, callee, receiver_fingerprint).

## Gate and staging

```bash
cargo xtask check-no-panic-family            # advisory (default)
cargo xtask check-no-panic-family --strict   # blocking
cargo xtask check-no-panic-family --json-output target/tokmd/reports/no-panic-report.json
```

The gate runs in two modes:

* **Advisory (default)** — schema/shape errors, expired allowlist entries, and
  stale entries (allowlist entries with no matching finding) are blocking.
  Unallowlisted findings are reported but do not fail the gate. This is the
  current CI mode while panic-family debt is burned down.
* **Strict (`--strict`)** — every unallowlisted finding is also blocking.
  This is the steady-state mode and the goal of the rollout.

The flip from advisory to strict is gated on three things, in this order:

1. Workspace member crates declare `[lints] workspace = true`, so the strict
   Clippy block is actually enforced per-crate.
2. Existing panic-family findings are either removed or receipted with
   allowlist entries (use `cargo xtask no-panic-propose` to seed the receipts).
3. CI runs `--strict` only after the advisory finding count reaches zero or
   matches the receipt ledger exactly.

The checker is wired into the `no_panic_policy` proof scope in
`ci/proof.toml` and runs as an advisory job in
`.github/workflows/no-panic-policy.yml` on every PR. The workflow writes the
uploaded JSON report through `--json-output` so the report path is owned by the
Rust checker instead of shell stdout redirection.

## Family taxonomy

The current detector recognises the following families
(see `xtask/src/tasks/no_panic.rs :: Family`):

| Family | Surface |
|--------|---------|
| `unwrap` | `.unwrap()` method calls. |
| `expect` | `.expect("…")` method calls. |
| `get_unwrap` | `.get(idx).unwrap()` chains. |
| `panic_macro` | `panic!(…)`. |
| `todo` | `todo!()`. |
| `unimplemented` | `unimplemented!()`. |
| `unreachable` | `unreachable!()`. |
| `element_indexing` | `slice[idx]` element indexing. |
| `range_indexing` | `slice[a..b]` range indexing. |

Future families considered in the rollout plan but not yet implemented:
`string_slice`, `unchecked_time_subtraction`. These can be added by
extending `Family` and the AST visitor in `xtask/src/tasks/no_panic.rs`.

## Adding entries

```bash
cargo xtask no-panic-propose
```

Writes proposed allowlist entries to
`target/no-panic-proposed-allowlist.toml`. Edit each proposed entry to
fill in `owner`, `classification`, `explanation`, and `expires`, then
move the entry into `policy/no-panic-allowlist.toml`. Re-run
`cargo xtask check-no-panic-family` to confirm the receipt covers the
finding.
