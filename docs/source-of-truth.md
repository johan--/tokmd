# Source of Truth Model

Status: active documentation convention.

This document defines where durable tokmd intent, behavior, decisions, plans,
agent-local state, and machine-checkable policy belong. It is a routing guide
for maintainers and agents, not a new product feature.

## Goal

Keep tokmd's repository knowledge reviewable and enforceable by putting each
kind of truth in the artifact that can best carry it. The repo-native spec
namespace is rooted at `.tokmd-spec/`; established source-of-truth documents
under `docs/` remain valid until they are deliberately promoted, indexed, moved,
or superseded.

The intended flow is:

```text
idea or problem
  -> proposal
  -> spec
  -> ADR when a durable architecture decision is needed
  -> implementation plan
  -> policy/checks
  -> receipts and PR evidence
```

Skipping a step is fine for small changes, but mixing these roles in one
document makes later work harder to audit.

## How to Use This Model

Start with the smallest artifact that can carry the truth without hiding it.
For routine code changes, a PR body with validation evidence may be enough. For
lanes that change behavior, architecture, sequencing, or checked policy, update
the owning artifact before relying on chat history.

When planning a lane:

1. Read `docs/NEXT.md` for the current operating mode.
2. Read `.tokmd-spec/index.toml` and the accepted plan/spec/ADR/policy files
   linked by `docs/NEXT.md`, the PR, or current repo guidance.
3. Create or update a proposal only when the why, alternatives, or open
   questions need durable review.
4. Create or update a spec when behavior, artifact shape, compatibility, or
   proof requirements change.
5. Create or update an ADR when a durable architecture, governance, packaging,
   or product-boundary decision changes.
6. Create or update a plan when PR sequencing, validation commands, dependencies,
   or stop conditions change.
7. Update checked TOML policy when a rule becomes machine-checkable.

When executing a lane:

- keep agent-local state small and clearly scoped to its agent;
- follow the linked plan rather than inventing a parallel queue;
- update specs before relying on new behavior contracts;
- update ADRs before relying on new durable architecture decisions;
- put raw run logs in run artifacts only when they are summarized into a durable
  finding, plan, or PR body;
- run `cargo xtask doc-artifacts --check` after changing source-of-truth
  artifacts.

Templates under `docs/templates/` are starting points for new artifacts. They
are not source-of-truth documents until copied into the owning directory and
filled with repo-specific content.

For an operational checklist that coding agents can follow before starting or
changing a lane, see `docs/agent-workflows/source-of-truth.md`.

## Artifact Roles

| Artifact | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.tokmd-spec/` | Repo-native durable namespace, index, future proposal/spec/ADR/lane/closeout artifacts, and links to durable artifacts that still live under `docs/`. | Tool-specific execution state, raw run logs, or unindexed alternate truth stores. |
| `docs/proposals/` | Exploratory rationale, alternatives, open questions, and the reason a change should exist before it becomes a contract. | Final behavior contracts, merge verdicts, or machine policy. |
| `docs/specs/` | Testable behavior contracts, artifact shapes, compatibility rules, proof requirements, and accepted semantics. | Historical decision rationale or PR-by-PR sequencing. |
| `docs/adr/` | Durable architecture, packaging, boundary, or governance decisions and their consequences. | Detailed behavior matrices that should be tested as specs. |
| `docs/plans/` | PR sequencing, implementation packets, validation commands, dependencies, and stop conditions. | Product contracts or architecture decisions. |
| `docs/ci/swarm-routing.md` | Repository topology, publication/swarm roles, import and fast-forward rules, and repo-conditional workflow boundaries. | Product behavior contracts, release evidence, or workflow implementation details. |
| `.jules/goals/active.toml` | Jules-local machine-readable state, suggestions, and linked context for Jules runs. | Codex primary lane selection, accepted product decisions, raw terminal logs, complete run history, or policy. |
| `.jules/runs/` | Per-run Jules packets, receipts, decisions, and PR bodies. | Codex primary lane selection, shared active state, or edited truth ledgers. |
| `.jules/friction/` | Structured future-work and friction items found by Jules runs. | Codex primary lane selection, current implementation plans, or accepted decisions. |
| `.codex/` | Codex-local tracked execution packets, operator notes, friction, or run provenance when present. | Jules run state, accepted product decisions, or shared truth ledgers. |
| `ci/proof.toml` | Proof scope classification, affected-plan policy, executor defaults, allowlists, and dependency/fixture rules. | Narrative rationale or PR sequencing. |
| `policy/*.toml` | Machine-checkable repo policies that are not proof-scope policy. | Human-only conventions. |
| PR bodies and comments | Review-local summary, validation evidence, links to durable artifacts, and disposition rationale. | Primary long-term truth when a repo artifact should exist. |

## Conflict Resolution

When artifacts disagree:

1. Machine-checked policy and schema files define what current tooling enforces.
2. Specs define intended behavior contracts.
3. ADRs explain why durable decisions exist.
4. Plans define the next implementation order, but never override specs or ADRs.
5. Proposals explain unaccepted or exploratory direction.
6. Agent-local state may point at a lane or suggestion, but it does not replace
   the linked plan, spec, ADR, policy, or PR context.

If a PR changes behavior, update the spec or schema that owns that behavior. If
it changes architecture boundaries, add or update an ADR. If it changes the
work order, update a plan. If it changes a checker, update the policy file and
its tests.

## Lifecycle

### Proposal

Use a proposal when the team needs to compare approaches or preserve why a lane
is worth doing. A proposal can be dropped without cleanup if no implementation
depends on it.

### Spec

Use a spec when a behavior or artifact shape should be testable. Specs should
name the proof commands or checks that keep the contract honest.

### ADR

Use an ADR when the repo needs a durable decision about architecture, public
surface, release governance, proof promotion, or product boundaries. ADRs should
link to specs rather than embedding every behavior detail.

### Plan

Use a plan when work needs sequencing. Plans should be concrete enough that a
future agent can pick the next PR without reopening the whole design discussion.

### Active agent state

Use `.jules/goals/active.toml` to make Jules-local state machine-readable. It
should be small and linked to durable human docs when useful for Jules. It
should not become a diary or Codex's primary active-lane controller.

When a lane completes or is superseded, archive the old active goal under
`.jules/goals/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-lane-slug.toml` only if the machine-readable
checkpoint has durable value. Archived goals are historical context; they do not
replace or compete with the current `active.toml`.

Codex-local state may live under `.codex/` when a Codex workflow needs a durable
in-repo packet. Jules suggestions remain useful inputs; they are not
instructions to stop Jules or discard Jules provenance.

### Policy

Use `ci/proof.toml` and files under `policy/` for rules that tooling can check.
Narrative docs may explain policy, but checked TOML is the source for automated
behavior.

## Review Expectations

For non-trivial PRs, the PR body should link to the relevant durable artifact:

- proposal for exploratory rationale;
- spec for behavior or artifact changes;
- ADR for durable architecture decisions;
- plan for sequencing;
- policy file for machine-checked rule changes;
- receipt or verifier output for proof evidence.

Docs-only PRs may update this routing model without changing product behavior,
schemas, proof promotion, Codecov defaults, or publish surface.
