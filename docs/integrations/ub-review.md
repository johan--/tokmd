# ub-review tokmd Sensor Recipe

Status: ready for review-bot and local use. This recipe shows how an
`ub-review` lane can attach scoped `tokmd` evidence without inventing a custom
undefined-behavior detector.

## Purpose

Use `tokmd` as a bounded evidence sensor for high-risk native-boundary review.
The artifacts answer what changed, whether the requested base/head refs
resolved, where effort and review risk concentrate, and what source context was
included, truncated, or skipped.

`tokmd` does not decide whether undefined behavior exists or is absent. It
packages reproducible review evidence for the bot, reviewer, and next agent.

## Inputs

Run the recipe from the repository under review, usually a Bun checkout or
fork. Pass the changed paths as positional arguments.

Set explicit refs:

```bash
BASE="${BASE:-origin/main}"
HEAD="${HEAD:-HEAD}"
```

The refs are part of the evidence contract. If either explicit ref does not
resolve, `tokmd analyze --preset bun-ub` fails and names the bad ref. A bot
should treat that as invalid evidence and should not attach a valid-looking
artifact.

## Review-Bot Recipe

```bash
BASE="${BASE:-origin/main}"
HEAD="${HEAD:-HEAD}"

mkdir -p sensors/tokmd

tokmd analyze \
  --preset bun-ub \
  --format md \
  --effort-base-ref "$BASE" \
  --effort-head-ref "$HEAD" \
  --no-progress \
  "$@" \
  > sensors/tokmd/analyze.md

tokmd analyze \
  --preset bun-ub \
  --format json \
  --effort-base-ref "$BASE" \
  --effort-head-ref "$HEAD" \
  --no-progress \
  "$@" \
  > sensors/tokmd/analyze.json

tokmd context \
  --budget 64000 \
  "$@" \
  > sensors/tokmd/context.md
```

Attach these artifacts:

| Artifact | Consumer | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sensors/tokmd/analyze.md` | reviewer | First-read human summary of scoped risk evidence. |
| `sensors/tokmd/analyze.json` | bot, ledger, agent | Machine-readable receipt with preset, refs, warnings, and signals. |
| `sensors/tokmd/context.md` | reviewer, agent | Context budget audit showing included, truncated, and skipped files. |

## Local Reviewer Recipe

Use the same command shape locally so bot artifacts and reviewer artifacts are
reproducible:

```bash
BASE=origin/main
HEAD=HEAD

tokmd analyze \
  --preset bun-ub \
  --format md \
  --effort-base-ref "$BASE" \
  --effort-head-ref "$HEAD" \
  --no-progress \
  src/runtime/api \
  > sensors/tokmd/analyze.md

tokmd context \
  --budget 64000 \
  src/runtime/api \
  > sensors/tokmd/context.md
```

Use the actual changed paths instead of `src/runtime/api` when the review scope
is narrower.

## Expected Behavior

- Analysis stays scoped to the paths passed at the end of the command.
- Bad explicit refs fail clearly instead of producing a generic baseline gap.
- `bun-ub` includes effort delta, git/churn, imports, complexity, API surface,
  and duplication signals.
- `bun-ub` excludes supply-chain, license, asset, dependency, novelty, and
  whole-repo deep scans.
- Context output shows charged tokens, full-file tokens, policy, and code lines
  so the budget can be reconciled from the rows.

## Fallback

If `bun-ub` is unavailable in an older `tokmd` binary, the weaker generic
fallback is:

```bash
tokmd analyze \
  --preset estimate \
  --format md \
  --effort-base-ref "$BASE" \
  --effort-head-ref "$HEAD" \
  --no-progress \
  "$@"
```

Use this only as generic effort evidence. It does not request the same import,
churn, complexity, API-surface, or duplication signals as `bun-ub`.

## Non-Claims

This recipe does not:

- prove that undefined behavior exists or is absent;
- replace a reviewer;
- run CI proof;
- promote coverage, mutation, fuzz, release, signing, or publish lanes;
- require whole-repo analysis unless `.` is passed as the changed scope.
