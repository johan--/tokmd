# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.11.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- `tokmd diff` now reports missing file-like inputs as missing or invalid paths
  before falling through to git-reference resolution, including outside a git
  repository.
- Nix release validation now includes review-packet schema files in the checked
  source tree and keeps receipt-status tests independent of repository-history
  availability when Nix check sources intentionally omit `.git`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-18

1.11 makes tokmd's evidence surfaces easier to consume: cockpit review
packets, coding-agent handoffs, proof receipts, browser/native guidance, and
release evidence now compose into practical workflows without promoting
advisory checks or changing public AST behavior.

This changelog is the concise release index. For the maintainer audit trail,
see `docs/releases/1.11-ledger.md`.

### Added

- Review packets and cockpit evidence: cockpit packets now surface
  review-first ordering, priority reasons, source-of-truth evidence,
  proof evidence, missing/stale/degraded/skipped/unavailable states, packet
  verification, and reproduction commands.
- Agent handoff/work-order: handoff bundles now include actionable
  `work-order.md` guidance, linked review-packet evidence, linked affected and
  proof-plan receipts, proof expectations, missing evidence, stop conditions,
  and agent guardrails.
- Proof and CI evidence receipts: proof observation, proof workflow status,
  proof artifact checks, CI risk-pack receipts, mutation summaries, mutation
  scope, no-panic family JSON, and RIPR annotations are easier to inspect as
  evidence without turning advisory telemetry into gates.
- User-path and adoption docs: install/try, Start Here, user paths, copy-ready
  workflows, sample artifact trees, GitHub Action quickstarts, browser-to-native
  guidance, and release-readiness docs now map jobs to commands, artifacts,
  open-first files, meanings, non-meanings, and next actions.
- Publishing and release evidence: release-facing docs now describe
  package-surface checks, version consistency, affected-proof routing, and
  proof-plan generation before any release mutation.
- Browser/WASM adoption: current-facing WASM/browser examples point at the
  staged `v1.11.0` artifact shape while browser mode is positioned as a
  no-install trial lens.
- AST shadow evidence: developer-facing AST tooling can compare heuristic Rust
  landmarks with Tree-sitter-backed Rust landmarks, write deterministic shadow
  artifacts, verify them, summarize mismatch counts, and record timing and
  function-boundary evidence. AST remains shadow-only.
- Release record: `docs/releases/1.11-ledger.md` now gives maintainers a
  lane-by-lane release ledger without flattening hundreds of PRs into this
  changelog.

### Changed

- MSRV and lint policy: the minimum supported Rust version moved from 1.93 to
  1.95, and the Rust 1.94/1.95 lint ratchets staged in
  `policy/clippy-lints.toml` are active.
- CI/proof orchestration: workflow-local shell and Python glue continued moving
  into Rust-owned `xtask` helpers where the result is consumed as review,
  proof, mutation, or annotation evidence.
- Browser/native positioning: browser docs now frame browser mode as a
  no-install trial lens with clear native-only boundaries, not native parity.
- First-run documentation: README, tutorial, recipes, Start Here, and user-path
  docs emphasize the shortest job-oriented paths instead of requiring readers
  to learn the proof-control plane first.
- Owner-module cleanup: cockpit and handoff internals continued moving toward
  smaller SRP owner modules while preserving public schema and CLI behavior.
- Advisory evidence boundary: proof remains advisory unless a maintainer
  explicitly promotes a check, and Codecov upload remains opt-in rather than a
  default release or CI behavior.

### Fixed

- Cockpit reproduction: review-map reproduction commands preserve the actual
  relative `--review-packet-dir` instead of always showing `.tokmd/review` or
  leaking absolute local paths.
- FFI and Python settings: JSON settings reject `paths: null` consistently,
  keep other nullable option fields on defaults, and make PyO3 extension-module
  behavior opt-in for the test harness.
- Unicode/content handling: UTF-8-sensitive analysis paths avoid
  byte/character index panics, and content tag counting treats empty tags as
  zero matches while respecting Unicode identifier boundaries.
- Context policy paths: Windows separators are normalized, and vendor, fixture,
  and generated directories match by exact path segment instead of broad
  substring matches.
- Numeric and rendering edges: average-line rounding avoids integer overflow,
  and complexity histogram Markdown handles narrow and zero-width rendering
  cases without malformed ASCII bars.
- Browser feedback: token rejection and worker progress states surface clearer
  browser-runner feedback.
- Test determinism: git fixture signing and generated coverage work were
  restacked into narrow keeper tests for cockpit review maps, cockpit comments,
  derived Markdown, core FFI parsing, effort helpers, complexity spans,
  proof-evidence model strings, git behavior, and in-memory row collection.
- Handoff smoke friction: generated `work-order.md` no longer tells readers to
  read itself from inside the work order.

### Internal / Governance

- Codex/Jules boundary: `.jules/**` remains Jules provenance and ambient
  suggestion state, while Codex uses repo docs, accepted plans/specs/ADRs,
  AGENTS.md, and `.codex` guidance as its operating surface.
- PR-bound Codex policy: implementation, review, release-prep, PR-drain, and
  changelog work authorize scoped commits, pushes, PR updates, and aligned
  merges after validation without redundant permission prompts.
- Generated PR triage: generated PRs were treated as scouts, with narrow
  correctness/test/release-surface keepers merged and duplicate or broad
  generated branches closed, parked, or superseded.
- Source-of-truth and doc-artifact enforcement: doc-artifact policy, receipts,
  CI upload, source-of-truth routing, and cockpit import support make
  documentation-control evidence visible in review packets.
- Known boundaries: 1.11 does not add `tokmd review`, proof promotion, default
  Codecov upload, default AST-backed output, evidencebus runtime integration,
  a release-readiness wrapper receipt, browser/native parity claims, or release
  mutation without explicit maintainer action.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-30

Stable release following `v1.10.0-rc.1` validation.

### Added

- GitHub Action mode dispatch for `module`, `export`, `gate`, `cockpit`, `sensor`, and `baseline`.
- GitHub Action outputs for `receipt`, `summary`, `gate-verdict`, `cockpit-report`, `sensor-report`, and `baseline-report`.
- GitHub Action base/head handling for cockpit and sensor workflows, including PR-base inference.
- GitHub Action test workflow coverage for expanded modes, outputs, artifact behavior, and path handling.
- Browser/WASM capability matrix documentation for current runner support versus native-only commands.
- Browser-runner validation checks that keep supported modes and analyze presets aligned with the capability matrix.
- Canonical publish-surface policy documentation for product, contract, workflow, capability, and non-crates.io package boundaries.
- Deterministic snapshot coverage for `tokmd analyze` JSON and Markdown output.
- Deterministic receipt coverage for `tokmd run` and `tokmd diff`.
- BDD coverage for `tokmd analyze --preset estimate`.
- Additional config-resolution, tokmd-types, effort-model, env-interpreter, module-children, and in-memory workflow proof coverage.
- `run_json("version")` now exposes `analysis_schema_version` when `tokmd-core` is built with analysis support.

### Changed

- Collapsed the previous support-crate sprawl into owner crates and SRP module families, including analysis leaf crates, rendering helpers, content/walk/fun/substrate helpers, and tool-schema helpers.
- Public crate surface is now enforced around product, contract, workflow, and capability crates.
- Release work completed crate-surface collapse and publish-surface verification, with package-list proof treating the 16 published crates as the intentional crates.io boundary (without treating production crates as `publish = false` placeholders).
- GitHub Action omitted mode continues the legacy module + export behavior, while explicit modes run one surface at a time.
- CLI reference docs are generated through checked `HELP` markers instead of manually maintained flag tables.
- No-default-features integration tests are feature-gated so the CLI test matrix respects optional analysis-dependent commands.
- Browser-runner payload validation stays rootless/in-memory and rejects native-only command shapes unless the capability matrix changes.
- README Action docs now cover explicit modes, outputs, artifacts, PR comments, base/head refs, and version pinning.
- README, roadmap, and implementation docs now separate shipped browser/WASM support from follow-up browser runtime polish.
- Architecture and testing docs now reflect the owner-module layout, current property-test entry points, and mutation-test paths.

### Fixed

- WASM timestamps now use real millisecond timestamps instead of silently emitting zero.
- Bounded root/path handling rejects unsafe native, Git-listed, and MemFs/rootless paths consistently.
- Git-listed paths are bounded under the validated root, including dirty-index and true-missing cases.
- Metadata diagnostics preserve missing/broken-path classification instead of flattening useful path errors.
- MemFs root semantics are explicit for `""`, `"."`, scoped subtrees, absolute paths, and parent traversal.
- FFI in-memory path handling rejects absolute paths and parent traversal at the boundary.
- Core workflows now default empty scan path lists to the current directory instead of reaching an upstream empty-path panic.
- Halstead tokenization handles CJK / multibyte text adjacent to operators without panicking on invalid UTF-8 byte slicing.
- Redacted path extension handling is limited to avoid extension leakage.
- Context budget validation rejects invalid negative or non-finite values.
- GitHub Action path splitting handles same-line and multiline `paths` inputs before mode-specific validation.
- Action gate and baseline modes reject multi-path input where the underlying command accepts exactly one path.
- Action cockpit and sensor base refs no longer assume `main` is fetched.
- `check-ignore` now fails loudly on missing paths.
- No-git baseline and `tokmd_git` resolution edge cases now resolve consistently.
- No-default-features integration tests are gated to avoid false failures in unsupported feature profiles.
- `tokmd-gate` now rejects malformed RFC 6901 pointer escapes and ambiguous array index tokens.
- Gate rule comparison failures now surface diagnostic messages for missing or invalid operands while preserving explicit rule messages.
- Cockpit `range_mode` parsing now validates accepted two-dot / three-dot values and fails clearly on invalid settings.
- Browser-runner runtime errors now preserve duck-typed `message` and `code` fields across worker / WASM boundaries.
- Receipt normalizers tolerate harmless whitespace differences in determinism tests.
- `normalize_path` prefix behavior has mutant-catching regression coverage.

### Internal

- Removed unused `pyo3-build-config` from `tokmd-python`.
- Removed redundant `tokio_rt` from `tokmd-node` and tightened `tokmd-wasm` dependency edges.
- Bumped dependency keepers including `jsonschema`, `clap_complete`, and `softprops/action-gh-release`.
- Updated cargo-mutants configuration for the current schema and restored mutation-test gate compatibility.
- Updated cargo-deny metadata by removing deprecated/stale license configuration and reducing release-check warning noise.
- Release workflow prerelease tags are marked as prereleases, excluded from `latest`, and kept away from stable crates.io, Docker, and major Action aliases.
- Added derived-report allocation cleanup.
- Added cockpit LCOV merge-path performance cleanup.
- Added version-consistency allocation cleanup.
- Removed the vulnerable RSA fixture dependency and added committed-fixture blob checks.
- Added unsafe-code guardrails at primary interfaces.
- Expanded Action self-tests across omitted mode, explicit modes, artifact outputs, inferred refs, and multi-path rejection rules.
- Jules provenance policy was clarified: intentional `.jules/**` provenance is allowed, while normal patch PRs should not carry accidental run packets.
- Consolidated Jules persona guidance and run/provenance indexing so intentional learning packets are distinguishable from runtime debris.
- Added/updated the Jules run index builder to aggregate historical ledgers without rewriting provenance history.
- Resolved duplicate release-prep PR families for pyo3 cleanup, no-default-features tests, analyze snapshots, browser-runner dynamic payloads, docs-marker drift, RC workflow guards, and ADR publishability policy.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- GitHub Action path handling was polished for released action usage.

- `jsonschema` features were tightened to drop unnecessary network and crypto crates.
- Workspace dependency pins were normalized.
- Analysis and redaction hot paths received allocation cleanups.

### Fixed

- **Tier Boundary Compliance**: Fixed architectural violation where `tokmd` CLI (Tier 5) directly depended on the analysis renderer, bypassing the `tokmd-core` facade (Tier 4) ([#996](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/tokmd/issues/996))
  - Added `analysis_facade` module in `tokmd-core` with renderer re-exports
  - Removed the direct analysis-renderer dependency from `tokmd` crate
  - Restored proper tier hierarchy: Tier 5 -> Tier 4 -> Tier 3
  - Feature-gated under `analysis` feature flag with explicit `#[cfg(feature = "analysis")]` guards
- FFI calls no longer panic on non-object JSON payloads.
- Browser runner protocol keeps `requestId` on error responses and extracts exact error codes.
- `--no-default-features` builds were repaired by decoupling git utilities and feature-gating unsupported tests.
- `--redact all` hides module roots and structural row names.
- CI, format, and clippy gates were restored after docs and PyO3 updates.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Browser/WASM product surface for `tokmd` via the new `tokmd-wasm` crate and `web/runner` browser runner
- In-browser `lang`, `module`, `export`, and rootless `analyze` support for ordered in-memory inputs
- Public GitHub repo ingestion in the browser through tree + contents APIs with deterministic in-memory input materialization and partial-load reporting

### Changed

- Browser runner deployments now consume a versioned `tokmd-wasm-<tag>.tar.gz` release artifact unpacked into `web/runner/vendor/tokmd-wasm`
- Release prep and publish metadata are aligned on `1.9.0` across Cargo and Node package surfaces

### Fixed

- Hardened browser runner boot and wasm export guardrails so unsupported bundles fail explicitly instead of degrading silently

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- Reduced allocations across git analysis, context packing, cockpit risk/lcov paths, dominant-language detection, polyglot report generation, complexity histogram rendering, and coupling computation
- Reset planning/reference docs after `1.8.0` so README, roadmap, release instructions, schema docs, and crate READMEs match the shipped command surface
- Moved unused `blake3`, `serde`, and content-helper edges out of production dependencies in `tokmd-analysis`

### Fixed

- Locked rounded COCOMO effort semantics with a retained regression seed and synced the schema/version docs that describe the estimate surface
- Replaced remaining unwrap/panic-heavy test paths in `tokmd-analysis-types` and the FFI envelope helpers, and hardened a Windows-sensitive traversal property test

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Effort estimation engine (`tokmd-analysis-effort` crate) with COCOMO 81, COCOMO II, and Monte Carlo models (#654)
- New `Estimate` analysis preset for effort-focused analysis
- Effort estimation section in Markdown receipt output (size basis, headline, model explanation, delta comparison)

- High-entropy key detection (`uselesskey`) runtime fixtures for security preset

### Changed

- `ANALYSIS_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped from 8 to 9
- Preset grid expanded from 11 to 12 presets (new `Estimate` preset)
- Receipt preset enriched: now enables dup, git, complexity, and API surface analysis
- Repository-native quality commands now handle the Windows `cargo fmt --all`/`xtask.exe` edge cases transparently
- Windows local builds now default to leaner debug info, with `cargo trim-target` and opt-in `sccache` support to reduce rebuild footprint

### Added

- WASM-ready I/O abstraction layer (`tokmd-io-port` crate with `ReadFs` trait and `MemFs`) (#510)
- Massive test expansion: ~3,000+ new tests across all tiers (waves 56–77) including property-based, BDD, snapshot, determinism, and cross-crate integration tests

### Fixed

## [1.7.2] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Near-duplicate detection enricher (`tokmd-analysis-near-dup`), commit intent classification, and focused microcrate extraction.
### Fixed

- `cargo xtask publish` now handles HTTP 429 rate-limit responses from crates.io by parsing the `retry-after` timestamp, sleeping until the cooldown expires, and retrying automatically instead of failing hard. This prevents partial releases when publishing many crates in sequence.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Added context-aware scanning and policy microcrates: `tokmd-context-git`, `tokmd-context-policy`.
- Added deterministic utility seams: `tokmd-exclude`, `tokmd-module-key`, `tokmd-path`, `tokmd-scan-args`, `tokmd-export-tree`, FFI envelope helpers, and `tokmd-math`.
- Added explainability, schema, and import analysis components: the analysis explain catalog, import analysis modules, `tokmd-analysis-maintainability`, `tokmd-tool-schema`, and analysis HTML rendering.

### Changed

- Refactored analysis and scan-related boundaries into focused microcrates and moved boundary-check logic.
- Updated CI/tooling around release and publish readiness (toolchain updates, boundary checks, deterministic ordering).

### Fixed

- Fixed clippy and lint failures to keep strict `--all-targets` check coverage clean.
- Generalized dependency and publishability checks in `cargo xtask publish`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Near-duplicate detection in analysis reports (`--near-dup`, `--near-dup-threshold`, `--near-dup-scope`, `--near-dup-max-files`)
- Commit intent classification in analysis git reports
- Coupling metrics: Jaccard similarity and Lift in analysis coupling reports
- `hash` field on `GitCommit` for commit SHA identification
- Explicit token estimation divisor fields (`bytes_per_token_low`, `bytes_per_token_high`)
- Serde alias tests locking backward compatibility of `tokens_min`/`tokens_max` renames
- Full `ContextReceipt` E2E backward compatibility test for token field renames

### Changed

- Renamed `tokens_low`/`tokens_high` → `tokens_min`/`tokens_max` with backward-compatible serde aliases
- Analysis schema version: 6 → 7

### Fixed

- Cockpit verdict rendering: exhaustive `GateStatus` match instead of wildcard catch-all
- `xtask bump`: fixed stale `ANALYSIS_SCHEMA_VERSION` current value (4 → 7), corrected `COCKPIT_SCHEMA_VERSION` path, added missing schema entries (`CONTEXT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `HANDOFF_SCHEMA_VERSION`)

## [1.6.3] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Analyze Explain Mode**: Added `tokmd analyze --explain <key>` for quick human-readable metric/finding definitions (`--explain list` for key discovery)
- **Diff Output Controls**: Added `tokmd diff --compact` and `tokmd diff --color <auto|always|never>` for narrow terminals and explicit color policy
- **Cockpit Trend Sparklines**: Added inline unicode sparklines for trend lines in cockpit markdown output
- **Structured CLI Error Hints**: Added actionable `Hints:` section on common failures (missing git, bad paths, missing refs, invalid explain key, TOML parse issues)
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Added `complexity.technical_debt` to analysis receipts (complexity points per KLOC + severity bucket)
- **Duplication Density**: Added `dup.density` with overall and per-module duplicate waste density metrics
- **Code Age Distribution**: Added `git.age_distribution` with file age buckets and recent-vs-prior refresh trend
- **Microcrate: `tokmd-progress`**: Extracted progress spinner/progress-bar primitives from CLI into a dedicated crate
- **Microcrate: `tokmd-badge`**: Extracted SVG badge rendering into a dedicated clap-free crate
- **Diff Summary Expansion**: Added side-by-side summary rows for LOC, lines, files, bytes, and tokens plus language movement counts
- **Cockpit Summary Comparison Table**: Added baseline-aware markdown comparison table (`Baseline`/`Current`/`Delta`/`Change`)

### Changed

- **Config Microcrate Extraction**: Moved `TomlConfig` schema/parsing types into `tokmd-settings`; `tokmd-config` now re-exports them for compatibility
- **CLI Wiring**: `tokmd` now consumes `tokmd-progress` and `tokmd-badge` instead of local modules
- **Determinism Gate Baseline Parsing**: Non-`ComplexityBaseline` files passed to `--baseline` now skip determinism gate instead of hard-failing cockpit runs
- **Release Guide Modernized**: `RELEASE.md` now documents the `cargo xtask publish` workflow (`--plan`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--from`, `--tag`) and removes stale `scripts/publish-all.ps1` references.

### Fixed

- **xtask Dry-Run Reliability**: `cargo xtask publish --dry-run` now validates each crate via `cargo package --list`, avoiding false failures from crates.io dependency propagation during lockstep release preparation.
- **Cockpit Determinism Baseline Validation**: malformed baseline JSON now fails loudly, and determinism auto-skip is limited to explicit cockpit receipts (`"mode": "cockpit"`).

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **tokmd-core Analyze Workflow**: Implemented `analyze_workflow(scan, analyze)` to run export + analysis directly from the library API and FFI (`run_json("analyze", ...)`)

### Changed

- **Analyze Settings Validation**: `preset` and `granularity` in FFI analyze args are now strictly validated with `invalid_settings` errors on unknown values

### Fixed

- **Bindings Analyze Path**: Python/Node binding tests now validate successful analyze receipts instead of obsolete `not_implemented` behavior

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **File Classification**: Auto-detect generated, vendored, fixture, lockfile, minified, sourcemap, and dense data blob files during context packing
- **Inclusion Policies**: Per-file budget caps (`--max-file-pct`, `--max-file-tokens`) with Full/HeadTail/Summary/Skip policies
- **Head/Tail Truncation**: Oversized files emit 60% head + 40% tail with omission marker
- **Graceful Metric Fallback**: When git scores unavailable for `--rank-by hotspot/churn`, falls back to code lines with transparent `fallback_reason`
- **Error Suggestions**: Actionable suggestions on git, config, and path errors (`with_suggestions()` builder)

### Changed

- **Handoff Schema**: v3 → v4 — added `rank_by_effective`, `fallback_reason`, `excluded_by_policy`, per-file `policy`/`classifications`
- **Context Bundle Schema**: v1 → v2 — added policy tracking fields
- **Context Receipt Schema**: Split from Core (`SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`) to own `CONTEXT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 3`
- **Diff Markdown**: Added comparison summary table (From / To / Delta / Change %)

### Fixed

- **Error Serialization**: `ResponseEnvelope::to_json()` fallback now emits actual error code and message instead of placeholders

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-11

  - Decouples lower-tier crates from `clap` dependency
  - Enables library usage and FFI/Python/Node bindings without pulling in CLI types

- **New Crate `tokmd-envelope`** (Tier 0): Cross-fleet sensor report contract
  - `SensorReport` envelope with schema `"sensor.report.v1"`

- **Core Workflows**: `tokmd-core` workflow functions now use settings types (`ScanSettings`, `LangSettings`, etc.) instead of Clap-based args
- **Envelope Schema**: Changed schema identifier from numeric `sensor_report_version: u32` to semantic string `schema: String` (`"sensor.report.v1"`)
- **Finding Identity**: Replaced `Finding.id` with `(check_id, code)` tuple for category-based routing
- **Analysis Types**: Moved envelope and findings types to dedicated `tokmd-envelope` crate
- **Core Settings**: `tokmd-core` re-exports from `tokmd-settings` for backwards compatibility
- **CLI Args**: Renamed `--out` to `--output` across `export`, `badge`, and `context` commands (old name kept as visible alias)
- **Context Command**: Renamed `--output` (mode selector) to `--mode` to avoid collision with `--output` (file path)
- **Cockpit Diff Coverage**: Now intersects LCOV data with git-added lines for accurate diff-scoped coverage instead of whole-file coverage

### Fixed

- **Rust Function Regex**: Fixed pattern to match `(_|XID_Start) XID_Continue*` per Rust language spec; `fn _private_helper()` now correctly detected
- **Cross-Platform Docs**: xtask docs task now normalizes `tokmd.exe` → `tokmd` and CRLF → LF for platform-independent reference output
