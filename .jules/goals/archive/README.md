# Archived Jules Goals

Completed or superseded active-goal files may be copied here when a lane needs a
durable machine-readable checkpoint after `active.toml` moves on.

Archive files are historical snapshots, not active execution state. The current
lane always lives in `.jules/goals/active.toml`, and `cargo xtask
doc-artifacts --check` validates only that active file in the first checker
slice.

## Naming

Use a date and short lane slug:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD-lane-slug.toml
```

Examples:

```text
2026-05-13-source-of-truth-docs.toml
2026-05-13-doc-artifacts-check.toml
```

## Archive Steps

1. Copy `.jules/goals/active.toml` into this directory.
2. Set `status` to `complete`, `superseded`, or `paused`.
3. Preserve the original `program`, `lane`, links, rules, and stop conditions.
4. Add only short machine-readable completion metadata if needed.
5. Keep raw logs and narrative run history in `.jules/runs/`, PR bodies, or
   linked plans instead.

Do not let archived goals become a second active queue. If archived state and
`active.toml` disagree, `active.toml` owns the current lane and the archive owns
only historical context.
