# tokmd Roadmap

This document outlines the evolution of `tokmd` and the path forward.

## Vision

`tokmd` is the **fast deterministic code-intelligence instrument** in the
Effortless Metrics evidence stack. It transforms repository scans into
actionable code receipts, review surfaces, proof-routing inputs, and LLM-ready
context for humans, machines, CI, and agents.

- **Receipt-Grade**: Outputs are deterministic, versioned, and safe for automated pipelines.
- **Analysis-Ready**: Rich derived metrics, git integration, and semantic analysis.
- **LLM-Native**: Designed for context planning, budget estimation, and AI workflows.

## Current Roadmap Status

The historical roadmap remains useful as a record of shipped milestones and
longer-term horizons. The active planning state is now selection-first:

- v1.11 browser runtime polish is complete.
- Cockpit/review evidence is stable as the current PR-review surface.
- Proof observation remains advisory, not promoted to required gates.
- AST remains shadow-only until broader comparison evidence justifies public
  schema or behavior changes.
- There is no selected implementation lane by default.

New work should start from one of:

1. a named user or maintainer consumer,
2. a missing artifact needed by that consumer,
3. a concrete workflow pain,
4. a product gap,
5. a release/distribution verification gap,
6. fresh measured performance evidence.

The current near-term product priorities are:

1. Release and distribution verification.
2. CLI/user-facing friction reduction.
3. Review evidence consumption.
4. Measured performance and CI feedback.
5. Browser/WASM capability-honest expansion.
6. AST shadow evidence, not public AST behavior.

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the agent workbench roadmap and lane selection
rules.

## Completed: v1.2.0 — Microcrate Architecture

**Goal**: Modular crate structure for selective compilation and ecosystem reuse.

This section records the historical v1.2.0 architecture milestone. The current
workspace has since consolidated implementation-only crates into owner modules;
see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and
[docs/publish-surface.md](docs/publish-surface.md) for the active crate graph
and publishing surface.

UX work is explicitly **incremental and non-breaking**:
- No changes to JSON/JSONL receipt schemas (these are machine surfaces)
- Terminal enhancements are opt-in and degrade gracefully on dumb terminals
- Progress output goes to stderr, never stdout (preserving pipe-ability)
- Color respects `NO_COLOR` / `CLICOLOR` environment conventions

## Completed: v1.7.1 — Focused Microcrate Extraction

**Goal**: Extract focused microcrates from monolithic modules for better separation of concerns.

This section records the extraction step that existed at the time. The current
architecture has kept the useful seams but moved implementation-only packages
back into single-responsibility owner modules.

### Extracted Boundaries

| Current owner | Tier | Purpose |
| :------------ | :--- | :------ |
| `tokmd-core` / `tokmd` owner modules | 4/5 | Context/handoff policy helpers and CLI wiring |
| `tokmd-format::scan_args` | 2 | Deterministic `ScanArgs` metadata construction |
| `tokmd-analysis-types` / owner modules | 0+ | Deterministic numeric/statistical helpers |
| `tokmd-scan` owner modules | 1 | Exclude-pattern, path, walk, and tokeignore helpers |
| `tokmd-model::module_key` | 1 | Deterministic module-key derivation |
| `tokmd-core` owner modules | 4 | Git-derived context ranking helpers |
| `tokmd-format::export_tree` | 2 | Deterministic tree renderers for analysis/handoff exports |
| `tokmd/src/analysis_explain` | 5 | CLI metric/finding explanation catalog and alias lookup |
| `tokmd-analysis` owner modules | 3 | Imports, maintainability, metrics, content, and enrichers |
| `tokmd` owner modules | 5 | AI tool-schema generation from clap command trees |
| `tokmd-envelope::ffi` | 0 | Shared FFI envelope parser for Python/Node bindings |

### Architectural Changes

- [x] Moved `AnalysisFormat` to `tokmd-types` (Tier 0) for broader reuse
- [x] Extracted focused boundaries from monolithic modules; later consolidation retained the seams as owner modules
- [x] Analysis schema version: 7 → 8
- [x] Workspace graph expanded beyond the original 16-crate v1.2.0 layout before later consolidation reduced implementation package surface
- [x] Fixed clippy/lint across all new crates for strict `--all-targets` check coverage
- [x] Updated CI/tooling for release and publish readiness

---

## Completed: v1.7.x — Deep Test Coverage Expansion

**Goal**: Achieve broad, multi-strategy test coverage across the workspace without breaking deterministic or release-facing surfaces.

### Test Numbers

| Metric | Current framing |
| :----- | :-------------- |
| Test depth | Expanded across unit, integration, snapshot, deep, property, fuzz, and mutation layers |
| Workspace reach | Coverage spread across essentially the full crate graph, including CLI and binding-facing seams |
| Determinism focus | Receipt stability, schema contracts, and cross-crate invariants locked in by dedicated suites |

### Coverage by Tier

| Tier | Crates Covered | Test Types Added |
| :--- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| 0 | `tokmd-types`, `tokmd-analysis-types`, `tokmd-settings`, `tokmd-envelope` | Determinism regression, contract expansion, boundary props |
| 1 | `tokmd-scan`, `tokmd-model`, and their path/walk/module-key owner modules | Property tests, deep proptests, snapshot suites |
| 2 | `tokmd-format`, `tokmd-git`, and format owner modules for badges, export trees, redaction, scan args, fun, and analysis rendering | Snapshot tests for renderers, traversal properties |
| 3 | `tokmd-analysis`, its enricher owner modules, `tokmd-cockpit`, and `tokmd-gate` | BDD scenarios, enricher contract verification, deep proptests |
| 4 | `tokmd-core`, `tokmd-envelope/src/ffi.rs` | FFI workflow integration, JSON API round-trip tests |
| 5 | `tokmd` CLI | E2E tests for `lang`, `module`, `export`, `run`, `analyze`, `diff`, `badge`, `gate`, `cockpit`, `context`, `handoff`, `sensor`, and `baseline` |

### What Landed (36+ PRs first wave, 16 PRs second wave)

- [x] Boundary verification tests across core types
- [x] Determinism regression tests for all receipt-producing paths
- [x] Byte-stable output regression suite with ordering locks
- [x] Error handling coverage for edge cases and malformed inputs
- [x] Snapshot tests (`insta`) for all format renderers (Markdown, TSV, JSON, HTML)
- [x] Deep analysis crate tests: complexity, halstead, near-dup, topics, entropy, license, archetype, fingerprint, API surface
- [x] CLI E2E tests for the core scan, analysis, review, sensor, and LLM-bundle commands
- [x] FFI and workflow integration tests in `tokmd-core`
- [x] Property tests expanded across 14+ crates with `proptest`
- [x] 3 new fuzz targets (import parser, export tree, policy TOML)
- [x] BDD-style scenario tests across the analysis owner-module surface
- [x] Doctest coverage expanded across crates

### CI & Performance

- [x] CI green on main with full mutation testing gate passing
- [x] macOS jobs gated to main-only pushes for CI cost control (#409)
- [x] Nix CI fixes: resolved `cloned_ref_to_slice_refs` clippy lint for cargo 1.93 (#407)
- [x] Fix-forward for typo, rustfmt, and content test failures (#390)
- [x] Reduced allocations in token stream formatting (perf improvement)

## Completed: v1.8.0 — Effort Estimation & Release Hardening

**Goal:** Expand `tokmd analyze` with first-class effort estimation while hardening the repo-native operator surface for CI, Windows, and release prep.

### What landed

- [x] **Effort estimation engine**: `tokmd-analysis` effort module with COCOMO 81, COCOMO II, and Monte Carlo scaffolding.
- [x] **Estimate preset and receipt/report support**: effort outputs now flow through analysis receipts and Markdown renderers.
- [x] **Preset grid expansion**: the analysis surface now exposes 12 presets, with `estimate` joining a stronger `receipt` baseline.
- [x] **Schema evolution**: analysis schema advanced to v9 to carry effort estimation data.
- [x] **WASM seam foundation**: `tokmd-io-port` landed with `ReadFs`, `HostFs`, and `MemFs` as the host-abstracted file access boundary.
- [x] **Windows-safe repo-native quality path**: repo-native fmt and publish flows avoid Windows `xtask.exe` self-lock and `cargo fmt --all` pain.
- [x] **Build-footprint reduction**: `cargo trim-target`, leaner Windows debug info defaults, and opt-in `sccache` support reduce local rebuild churn.
- [x] **CI/release boringness**: workflow concurrency, smarter Rust caching, Node 24 Nix canary, and a clean tag-driven `1.8.0` release through GitHub Actions.

### Notes

- The full in-memory scan path and wasm CI parity work did not fully land in `1.8.0`; that continuation is now the next milestone instead of implicit spillover.

## Completed: v1.9.0 — Browser/WASM Productization

**Goal:** Finish the browser/WASM product surface around the already-landed in-memory execution path and make the supported browser workflow explicit, repeatable, and capability-honest.

### What shipped in v1.9.0

- [x] `tokmd-io-port`, in-memory scan/model/core workflow seams, and lower-tier clap-free boundaries now keep browser/WASM execution honest.
- [x] `tokmd-wasm` exposes browser-friendly entrypoints for `lang`, `module`, `export`, and browser-safe `analyze`.
- [x] Native-vs-wasm parity coverage exists for `lang`, `module`, `export`, `analyze receipt`, and `analyze estimate`.
- [x] `web/runner` boots the real `tokmd-wasm` bundle in a dedicated worker, reports capabilities, renders the latest successful result, and supports JSON download.
- [x] Public GitHub repo acquisition uses the browser-safe GitHub tree and contents APIs to materialize deterministic ordered inputs locally in the page.
- [x] `tokmd-wasm` browser bundle is deployed as a versioned release artifact consumed directly from `web/runner/vendor/tokmd-wasm`.
- [x] Browser runner guardrails landed around capability reporting, supported modes, and in-memory input validation.

### Supported browser-safe surface today

- Browser/WASM modes: `lang`, `module`, `export`
- Browser/WASM analyze presets: `receipt`, `estimate`
- Public repo acquisition strategy: GitHub tree + contents API, not zipball fetch
- Capability reporting is explicit about unavailable host-backed enrichers and reserved protocol features

### Current browser constraints

- Browser-safe analysis should expand only where the preset can stay rootless and capability-honest.

### Non-goals for v1.9.0

- No browser-side git-history churn/hotspot metrics; keep those as explicit capability misses or backend follow-ups.
- No browser zipball ingestion as the primary supported path for `v1.9.0`; tree+contents is the supported browser acquisition strategy.
- No mutation testing or other heavy tooling in-browser.

## Completed: v1.10.0 — CI Control Plane, Trust Hardening, and Proof Stability

**Goal:** Ship the stable release after the Action, path-trust, WASM, publish-surface, and proof-hardening work landed and the release candidate was validated.

### What is in v1.10.0

- [x] GitHub Action explicit modes for `module`, `export`, `gate`, `cockpit`, `sensor`, and `baseline`.
- [x] Bounded path/root handling across native, Git, and in-memory flows.
- [x] WASM capability truth through matrix checks, timestamp correctness, and runner contract validation.
- [x] Publish-surface enforcement across product, contract, workflow, and capability crates.
- [x] Determinism and proof coverage for analyze snapshots, run/diff receipts, effort serde, and core CLI behavior.
- [x] CLI reference docs generated through checked HELP markers.

## v1.11.0 — Browser Runtime Polish

**Goal:** Deliver the browser runtime polish deferred from the v1.10 release fence: explicit cache semantics, visible progress, resilient fetch UX, and safe authenticated-fetch boundaries.

### What shipped for v1.11.0

- [x] Browser cache key/invalidation semantics.
- [x] Browser worker and repo-load progress visibility.
- [x] Retry and rate-limit UX with retry-after guidance.
- [x] Auth-safe fetch/cache boundaries with session-only token state.

## Future Horizons

### v1.12.x — Selection-First Product and Evidence Work

_Goal: Choose the next implementation lane deliberately from release, adoption, review-evidence, workflow, browser, performance, or AST-shadow evidence gaps._

Potential lanes:

- Release/distribution verification.
- CLI and adoption UX.
- Review evidence consumption.
- Measured performance and CI feedback.
- Browser/WASM rootless capability expansion.
- AST shadow evidence expansion.

Architecture consolidation is paused unless fresh product or proof evidence
shows a real owner-module problem.

### v2.0 — Platform Evolution

#### A. AI Agent Integration & MCP Server Mode

_Goal: Native integration with Claude and other MCP-compatible clients._

- **Tool definitions** ✅: `tokmd tools` already emits OpenAI, Anthropic, and JSON Schema definitions for agent/tool consumers.
- **Future server**: `tokmd serve` remains planned for MCP server interaction.
- Resources: Expose receipts as MCP resources
- Tools: `scan`, `analyze`, `diff`, `suggest` as MCP tools
- Streaming: Incremental analysis results

#### B. Streaming Analysis

_Goal: Handle massive repositories without memory pressure._

- JSONL streaming for all outputs
- Incremental file processing
- Memory-bounded analysis limits
- Progress reporting via stderr

#### C. Plugin System

_Goal: Extensible enrichers without core changes._

- WASM plugin interface for custom analyzers
- Plugin discovery from `~/.tokmd/plugins/`
- Schema for plugin metadata and capabilities

### v2.1 — Intelligence Features

#### D. Smart Suggestions

_Goal: Actionable recommendations, not just metrics._

- `tokmd suggest --budget 128k` — Files to include for context
- `tokmd suggest --review` — Files likely to need attention
- `tokmd suggest --test` — Untested code paths

#### E. Diff Intelligence

_Goal: Semantic diff beyond structural changes._

- Complexity delta detection
- Breaking change indicators
- Migration path suggestions

#### F. Watch Mode

_Goal: Continuous analysis during development._

- `tokmd watch` — Re-analyze on file changes
- Integration with LSP for editor feedback
- Real-time metric updates

### v2.2 — Ecosystem Integration

#### G. CI/CD Native

_Goal: First-class CI pipeline support._

- GitHub Action with PR comments
- GitLab CI template
- Trend tracking across commits
- Threshold-based failures (e.g., fail if complexity increases)

#### H. Editor Extensions

_Goal: Analysis at your fingertips._

- VS Code extension with inline metrics
- Neovim plugin for buffer analysis
- JetBrains plugin

#### I. Cloud Dashboard

_Goal: Historical tracking and team insights._

- Receipt aggregation service
- Trend visualization
- Team comparison views
- Alert on anomalies

### v3.0 — Tree-sitter Integration (Long-term)

_Goal: Accurate parsing for precise metrics. This is a significant undertaking requiring substantial R&D investment and is intentionally deferred well beyond the v2.x roadmap for full default integration, but foundation shadow work has begun._

#### J. Tree-sitter AST Parsing

- ✅ Feature-gated AST foundation defined by ADR-0008 (landed behind `ast` feature)
- ✅ Rust-first owner module under `tokmd-analysis` before any public parser crate
- Shadow comparison artifacts for heuristic-vs-AST function, import, and control-flow evidence
- Later language-specific complexity rules only after deterministic shadow evidence
- Public receipt/schema changes only after schema review and migration policy

---

## Non-Goals

These are explicitly out of scope for tokmd:

- **Code formatting/linting** — Use dedicated tools (rustfmt, eslint)
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** — tokmd delegates to external tools (cargo-audit, npm audit) when available; it does not maintain its own advisory database
- **Test execution** — Use cargo test, pytest, jest
- **Build orchestration** — Use cargo, make, just
- **Default full AST analysis** — tokmd remains heuristic-first until feature-gated AST shadow evidence justifies public receipt/schema changes

---
